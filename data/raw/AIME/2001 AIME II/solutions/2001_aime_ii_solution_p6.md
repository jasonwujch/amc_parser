## Problem

Square $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle . Square $EFGH$ has vertices $E$ and $F$ on $\overline{CD}$ and vertices $G$ and $H$ on the circle. If the area of square $ABCD$ is $1$ , then the area of square $EFGH$ can be expressed as $\frac {m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n$ . Find $10n + m$ .

## Solution 1a (Pythagorean theorem)
Let $O$ be the center of the circle, $2a$ be the side length of square $ABCD$ , and $2b$ be the side length of square $EFGH$ . By symmetry, the horizontal and vertical displacements of $C$ from $O$ are both $\frac{2a}{2} = a$ , so by the Pythagorean theorem , the radius of the circle is $OC = \sqrt{a^2+a^2} = a\sqrt{2}$ .
Now let $I$ be the midpoint of $\overline{GH}$ , giving $\overline{GI} = \frac{2b}{2} = b$ , and let $J$ be the point where $\overline{OI}$ intersects $\overline{CD}$ . We observe that since a diameter bisects a chord perpendicular to it, $\overline{GH}$ must be perpendicular to the diameter passing through $I$ . This means that triangle $OGI$ has a right angle at $I$ , and that $\overline{OJ}$ and $\overline{JI}$ are both parallel to $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{FG}$ . As the horizontal displacement of $C$ from $O$ is $a$ (from above), it follows that $\overline{OJ} = a$ , and hence \[\overline{OI} = \overline{OJ}+\overline{JI} = a+\overline{FG} = a+2b,\] so by the Pythagorean Theorem again,
\begin{align*} \overline{OG}^2 = \overline{OI}^2 + \overline{GI}^2 &\iff \left(a\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = (a+2b)^2 + b^2 \\ &\iff 2a^2 = a^2+4ab+4b^2+b^2 \\ &\iff a^2-4ab-5b^2 = 0 \\ &\iff (a-5b)(a+b) = 0 \end{align*}
Since lengths must be positive, we clearly cannot have $a+b = 0$ , so the solution must instead be $a = 5b$ . Since the ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths, we deduce that the required ratio is $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}$ , and so the answer is $10 \cdot 25 + 1 = \boxed{251}$ .

## Solution 1b (alternative finish for Solution 1a)
After establishing that $a^2-4ab-5b^2 = 0$ , another way to proceed is to observe that what we actually need to calculate is $\frac{b}{a}$ . Accordingly, we divide both sides of this equation by $a^2$ (or equivalently, choose units such that the area of square $ABCD$ is $1$ , without loss of generality), giving \[1-4\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)-5\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 = 0,\] which is a quadratic in precisely the variable $\frac{b}{a}$ . Thus, by solving it, we immediately obtain $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{5}$ or $\frac{b}{a} = -1$ , and as in Solution 1a, the negative root is obviously extraneous. Hence the required ratio of areas is $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}$ , and so the answer is $10 \cdot 25 + 1 = \boxed{251}$ .

## Solution 2 (coordinates)
Let $A$ be the top-left vertex of square $ABCD$ , and label the rest of the vertices in alphabetical order going clockwise from $A$ . Let $D$ have coordinates $(0,0)$ and the side length of square $ABCD$ be $a$ . Let $\overline{DF} = b$ , the midpoint of $\overline{EF}$ be $J$ , and $\overline{PQ}$ be the diameter of the circle that passes through $J$ . Since a diameter bisects a chord perpendicular to it, we deduce that $\overline{CJ} = \overline{DJ}$ , while $\overline{JE} = \overline{JF}$ by the definition of the midpoint, so $\overline{CE} = \overline{CJ}+\overline{JE} = \overline{DJ}+\overline{JF} = \overline{DF} = b$ . It follows that \[2b = \overline{CE}+\overline{DF} = \left(\overline{CF}+\overline{FE}\right)+\left(\overline{DE}+\overline{FE}\right) = \left(\overline{CF}+\overline{DE}\right)+2\overline{FE} = \left(\overline{CD}-\overline{FE}\right)+2\overline{FE} = \overline{CD}+\overline{FE} = a+\overline{FE},\] so the side length of square $EFGH$ is $\overline{FE} = 2b-a$ , and as $F$ has coordinates $(b,0)$ , $G$ therefore has coordinates $(b,2b-a)$ .
Now, by symmetry, the center of the circle is the same as the center of the square, i.e. $\left(\frac{a}{2},\frac{a}{2}\right)$ , and so its radius is half of the square's diagonal, i.e. $\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . This means the equation of the circle is \[\left(x-\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y-\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{2},\] and as $G$ lies on the circle, its coordinates must satisfy this equation, yielding \[\left(b-\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\left(2b-a\right)-\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{2}.\] Upon simplifying, this becomes $2a^2-7ab+5b^2 = 0$ , which factors as $(2a-5b)(a-b) = 0$ . Recalling that $b = \overline{DF} < \overline{DC} = a$ , we cannot have $a = b$ , so the solution must instead be $b = \frac{2}{5}a$ . Thus the required ratio of areas is \[\left(\frac{a-2b}{a}\right)^2 = \left(1-2\cdot\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 = \left(1-2\cdot\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25},\] so the answer is $10 \cdot 25 + 1 = \boxed{251}$ .
