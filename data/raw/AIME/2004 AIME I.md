Problem 5
Alpha and Beta both took part in a two-day problem-solving competition. At the end of the second day, each had attempted questions worth a total of $500$ points. Alpha scored $160$ points out of $300$ points attempted on the first day, and scored $140$ points out of $200$ points attempted on the second day. Beta who did not attempt $300$ points on the first day, had a positive integer score on each of the two days, and Beta's daily success rate (points scored divided by points attempted) on each day was less than Alpha's on that day. Alpha's two-day success ratio was $\frac{300}{500} = \frac{3}{5}$ . The largest possible two-day success ratio that Beta could achieve is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$ ?

A unicorn is tethered by a 20-foot silver rope to the base of a magician's cylindrical tower whose radius is 8 feet. The rope is attached to the tower at ground level and to the unicorn at a height of 4 feet. The unicorn has pulled the rope taut, the end of the rope is 4 feet from the nearest point on the tower, and the length of the rope that is touching the tower is $\frac{a-\sqrt{b}}c$ feet, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is prime. Find $a+b+c.$
