## Problem

For $t = 1, 2, 3, 4$ , define $S_t = \sum_{i = 1}^{350}a_i^t$ , where $a_i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ . If $S_1 = 513$ and $S_4 = 4745$ , find the minimum possible value for $S_2$ .

## Solution
Because the order of the $a$ 's doesn't matter, we simply need to find the number of $1$ s $2$ s $3$ s and $4$ s that minimize $S_2$ . So let $w, x, y,$ and $z$ represent the number of $1$ s, $2$ s, $3$ s, and $4$ s respectively. Then we can write three equations based on these variables. Since there are a total of $350$ $a$ s, we know that $w + x + y + z = 350$ . We also know that $w + 2x + 3y + 4z = 513$ and $w + 16x + 81y + 256z = 4745$ . We can now solve these down to two variables: \[w = 350 - x - y - z\] Substituting this into the second and third equations, we get \[x + 2y + 3z = 163\] and \[15x + 80y + 255z = 4395.\] The second of these can be reduced to \[3x + 16y + 51z = 879.\] Now we substitute $x$ from the first new equation into the other new equation. \[x = 163 - 2y - 3z\] \[3(163 - 2y - 3z) + 16y + 51z = 879\] \[489 + 10y + 42z = 879\] \[5y + 21z = 195\] Since $y$ and $z$ are integers, the two solutions to this are $(y,z) = (39,0)$ or $(18,5)$ . If you plug both these solutions in to $S_2$ it is apparent that the second one returns a smaller value. It turns out that $w = 215$ , $x = 112$ , $y = 18$ , and $z = 5$ , so $S_2 = 215 + 4*112 + 9*18 + 16*5 = 215 + 448 + 162 + 80 = \boxed{905}$ .
