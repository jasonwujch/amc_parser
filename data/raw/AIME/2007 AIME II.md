Problem 1
A mathematical organization is producing a set of commemorative license plates. Each plate contains a sequence of five characters chosen from the four letters in AIME and the four digits in $2007$ . No character may appear in a sequence more times than it appears among the four letters in AIME or the four digits in $2007$ . A set of plates in which each possible sequence appears exactly once contains N license plates. Find N/10.

Problem 4
The workers in a factory produce widgets and whoosits. For each product, production time is constant and identical for all workers, but not necessarily equal for the two products. In one hour, $100$ workers can produce $300$ widgets and $200$ whoosits. In two hours, $60$ workers can produce $240$ widgets and $300$ whoosits. In three hours, $50$ workers can produce $150$ widgets and $m$ whoosits. Find $m$ .

Problem 11
Two long cylindrical tubes of the same length but different diameters lie parallel to each other on a flat surface . The larger tube has radius $72$ and rolls along the surface toward the smaller tube, which has radius $24$ . It rolls over the smaller tube and continues rolling along the flat surface until it comes to rest on the same point of its circumference as it started, having made one complete revolution. If the smaller tube never moves, and the rolling occurs with no slipping, the larger tube ends up a distance $x$ from where it starts. The distance $x$ can be expressed in the form $a\pi+b\sqrt{c},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are integers and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime . Find $a+b+c.$

Problem 13
A triangular array of squares has one square in the first row, two in the second, and in general, $k$ squares in the $k$ th row for $1 \leq k \leq 11.$ With the exception of the bottom row, each square rests on two squares in the row immediately below (illustrated in given diagram). In each square of the eleventh row, a $0$ or a $1$ is placed. Numbers are then placed into the other squares, with the entry for each square being the sum of the entries in the two squares below it. For how many initial distributions of $0$ 's and $1$ 's in the bottom row is the number in the top square a multiple of $3$ ?
