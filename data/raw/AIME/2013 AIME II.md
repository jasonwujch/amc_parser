Problem 1
Suppose that the measurement of time during the day is converted to the metric system so that each day has $10$ metric hours, and each metric hour has $100$ metric minutes. Digital clocks would then be produced that would read $\text{9:99}$ just before midnight, $\text{0:00}$ at midnight, $\text{1:25}$ at the former $\text{3:00}$ AM, and $\text{7:50}$ at the former $\text{6:00}$ PM. After the conversion, a person who wanted to wake up at the equivalent of the former $\text{6:36}$ AM would set his new digital alarm clock for $\text{A:BC}$ , where $\text{A}$ , $\text{B}$ , and $\text{C}$ are digits. Find $100\text{A}+10\text{B}+\text{C}$ .

Problem 3
A large candle is $119$ centimeters tall. It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom. Specifically, the candle takes $10$ seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, $20$ seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and $10k$ seconds to burn down the $k$ -th centimeter. Suppose it takes $T$ seconds for the candle to burn down completely. Then $\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit, the candle's height in centimeters will be $h$ . Find $10h$ .

Problem 7
A group of clerks is assigned the task of sorting $1775$ files. Each clerk sorts at a constant rate of $30$ files per hour. At the end of the first hour, some of the clerks are reassigned to another task; at the end of the second hour, the same number of the remaining clerks are also reassigned to another task, and a similar assignment occurs at the end of the third hour. The group finishes the sorting in $3$ hours and $10$ minutes. Find the number of files sorted during the first one and a half hours of sorting.

Problem 9
A $7\times 1$ board is completely covered by $m\times 1$ tiles without overlap; each tile may cover any number of consecutive squares, and each tile lies completely on the board. Each tile is either red, blue, or green. Let $N$ be the number of tilings of the $7\times 1$ board in which all three colors are used at least once. For example, a $1\times 1$ red tile followed by a $2\times 1$ green tile, a $1\times 1$ green tile, a $2\times 1$ blue tile, and a $1\times 1$ green tile is a valid tiling. Note that if the $2\times 1$ blue tile is replaced by two $1\times 1$ blue tiles, this results in a different tiling. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ .
