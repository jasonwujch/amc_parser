## Solution 1
First of all, draw a good diagram! This is always the key to solving any geometry problem. Once you draw it, realize that $EF=2, FA=16$ . Why? Because since the hexagon is equiangular, we can put an equilateral triangle around it, with side length $6+8+10=24$ . Then, if you drew it to scale, notice that the "widest" this circle can be according to $AF, CD$ is $7\sqrt{3}$ . And it will be obvious that the sides won't be inside the circle, so our answer is $\boxed{147}$ .

## Solution 2
Like solution 1, draw out the large equilateral triangle with side length $24$ . Let the tangent point of the circle at $\overline{CD}$ be G and the tangent point of the circle at $\overline{AF}$ be H. Clearly, GH is the diameter of our circle, and is also perpendicular to $\overline{CD}$ and $\overline{AF}$ .
The equilateral triangle of side length $10$ is similar to our large equilateral triangle of $24$ . And the height of the former equilateral triangle is $\sqrt{10^2-5^2}=5\sqrt{3}$ . By our similarity condition, $\frac{10}{24}=\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{d+5\sqrt{3}}$
Solving this equation gives $d=7\sqrt{3}$ , and $d^2=\boxed{147}$
