# 2000 AIME I Problem 3

## Problem

In the expansion of $(ax + b)^{2000},$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers, the coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $x^{3}$ are equal. Find $a + b$ .

## Solution
Using the binomial theorem , $\binom{2000}{1998} b^{1998}a^2 = \binom{2000}{1997}b^{1997}a^3 \Longrightarrow b=666a$ .
Since $a$ and $b$ are positive relatively prime integers, $a=1$ and $b=666$ , and $a+b=\boxed{667}$ .
