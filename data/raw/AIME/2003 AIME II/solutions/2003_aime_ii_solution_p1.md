# 2003 AIME II Problem 1

## Problem

The product $N$ of three positive integers is $6$ times their sum , and one of the integers is the sum of the other two. Find the sum of all possible values of $N$ .

## Solution
Let the three integers be $a, b, c$ . $N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$ . Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$ . Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\{a, b\}$ is one of $\{1, 12\}, \{2, 6\}, \{3, 4\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so the sum of all possible values of $N$ is $12 \cdot (13 + 8 + 7) = 12(28) = \boxed{336}$ .
