Solution

Problem 2
For each positive integer $k,$ let $S_k$ denote the increasing arithmetic sequence of integers whose first term is 1 and whose common difference is $k.$ For example, $S_3$ is the sequence $1,4,7,10,\ldots.$ For how many values of $k$ does $S_k$ contain the term 2005?

Solution

Problem 4
The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.

Solution

Problem 5
Robert has 4 indistinguishable gold coins and 4 indistinguishable silver coins. Each coin has an engraving of one face on one side, but not on the other. He wants to stack the eight coins on a table into a single stack so that no two adjacent coins are face to face. Find the number of possible distinguishable arrangements of the 8 coins.

Solution

Problem 9
Twenty-seven unit cubes are painted orange on a set of four faces so that the two unpainted faces share an edge. The 27 cubes are then randomly arranged to form a $3\times 3 \times 3$ cube. Given that the probability that the entire surface of the larger cube is orange is $\frac{p^a}{q^br^c},$ where $p,q,$ and $r$ are distinct primes and $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, find $a+b+c+p+q+r.$
