Problem 5
A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$ . The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\sqrt {n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$ .

Ten identical crates each of dimensions $3$ ft $\times$ $4$ ft $\times$ $6$ ft. The first crate is placed flat on the floor.

Problem 12
On a long straight stretch of one-way single-lane highway, cars all travel at the same speed and all obey the safety rule: the distance from the back of the car ahead to the front of the car behind is exactly one car length for each 15 kilometers per hour of speed or fraction thereof (Thus the front of a car traveling 52 kilometers per hour will be four car lengths behind the back of the car in front of it.) A photoelectric eye by the side of the road counts the number of cars that pass in one hour. Assuming that each car is 4 meters long and that the cars can travel at any speed, let $M$ be the maximum whole number of cars that can pass the photoelectric eye in one hour. Find the quotient when $M$ is divided by 10.

Problem 15
A square piece of paper has sides of length $100$ . From each corner a wedge is cut in the following manner: at each corner, the two cuts for the wedge each start at distance $\sqrt {17}$ from the corner, and they meet on the diagonal at an angle of $60^\circ$ (see the figure below). The paper is then folded up along the lines joining the vertices of adjacent cuts. When the two edges of a cut meet, they are taped together. The result is a paper tray whose sides are not at right angles to the base. The height of the tray, that is, the perpendicular distance between the plane of the base and the plane formed by the upper edges, can be written in the form $\sqrt [n]{m}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, $m < 1000$ , and $m$ is not divisible by the $n$ th power of any prime. Find $m + n$ .
