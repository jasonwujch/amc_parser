Problem 6
Steve says to Jon, "I am thinking of a polynomial whose roots are all positive integers. The polynomial has the form $P(x) = 2x^3-2ax^2+(a^2-81)x-c$ for some positive integers $a$ and $c$ . Can you tell me the values of $a$ and $c$ ?" After some calculations, Jon says, "There is more than one such polynomial." Steve says, "You're right. Here is the value of $a$ ." He writes down a positive integer and asks, "Can you tell me the value of $c$ ?" Jon says, "There are still two possible values of $c$ ." Find the sum of the two possible values of $c$ .
