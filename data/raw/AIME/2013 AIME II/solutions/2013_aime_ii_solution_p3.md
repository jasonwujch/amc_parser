## Problem

A large candle is $119$ centimeters tall. It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom. Specifically, the candle takes $10$ seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, $20$ seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and $10k$ seconds to burn down the $k$ -th centimeter. Suppose it takes $T$ seconds for the candle to burn down completely. Then $\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit, the candle's height in centimeters will be $h$ . Find $10h$ .

## Solution
We find that $T=10(1+2+\cdots +119)$ . From Gauss's formula, we find that the value of $T$ is $10(7140)=71400$ . The value of $\frac{T}{2}$ is therefore $35700$ . We find that $35700$ is $10(3570)=10\cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ , so $3570=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ . As a result, $7140=k(k+1)$ , which leads to $0=k^2+k-7140$ . We notice that $k=84$ , so the answer is $10(119-84)=\boxed{350}$ .
