Solution

Problem 2
A 100 foot long moving walkway moves at a constant rate of 6 feet per second. Al steps onto the start of the walkway and stands. Bob steps onto the start of the walkway two seconds later and strolls forward along the walkway at a constant rate of 4 feet per second. Two seconds after that, Cy reaches the start of the walkway and walks briskly forward beside the walkway at a constant rate of 8 feet per second. At a certain time, one of these three persons is exactly halfway between the other two. At that time, find the distance in feet between the start of the walkway and the middle person.

Solution

Problem 5
The formula for converting a Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to the corresponding Celsius temperature $C$ is $C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32).$ An integer Fahrenheit temperature is converted to Celsius, rounded to the nearest integer, converted back to Fahrenheit, and again rounded to the nearest integer. For how many integer Fahrenheit temperatures between $32$ and $1000$ inclusive does the original temperature equal the final temperature?

Solution

Problem 6
A frog is placed at the origin on the number line , and moves according to the following rule: in a given move, the frog advances to either the closest point with a greater integer coordinate that is a multiple of $3$ , or to the closest point with a greater integer coordinate that is a multiple of $13$ . A move sequence is a sequence of coordinates which correspond to valid moves, beginning with $0$ , and ending with $39$ . For example, $0,\ 3,\ 6,\ 13,\ 15,\ 26,\ 39$ is a move sequence. How many move sequences are possible for the frog?

Problem 9
In right triangle $ABC$ with right angle $C$ , $CA = 30$ and $CB = 16$ . Its legs $CA$ and $CB$ are extended beyond $A$ and $B$ . Points $O_1$ and $O_2$ lie in the exterior of the triangle and are the centers of two circles with equal radii.

The length of the radius of either circle can be expressed as $p/q$ , where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$ .

Problem 11
For each positive integer $p$ , let $b(p)$ denote the unique positive integer $k$ such that $|k-\sqrt{p}| < \frac{1}{2}$ . For example, $b(6) = 2$ and $b(23) = 5$ . If $S = \sum_{p=1}^{2007} b(p),$ find the remainder when $S$ is divided by 1000.
