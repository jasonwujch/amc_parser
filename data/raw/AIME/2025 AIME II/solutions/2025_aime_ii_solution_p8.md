# 2025 AIME II Problem 8

## Problem

From an unlimited supply of $1$ -cent coins, $10$ -cent coins, and $25$ -cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called $\textit{greedy algorithm}$ , successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N$ . For example, to get $42$ cents, Silas will choose a $25$ -cent coin, then a $10$ -cent coin, then $7$ $1$ -cent coins. However, this collection of $9$ coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of $42$ cents; indeed, choosing $4$ $10$ -cent coins and $2$ $1$ -cent coins achieves the same total value with only $6$ coins.

In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of $1$ -cent, $10$ -cent, and $25$ -cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.

## Solution 1
We begin by noting that all values of $N \leq 25$ work without issue.
Starting from $N = 25$ to $29$ , the greedy algorithm will select the $25$ -cent coin, and no problem arises.
From $N = 30$ to $34$ , the greedy algorithm will select the $25$ -cent coin along with $5$ $1$ -cent coins to reach a total of $30$ , while the optimal solution would involve using $3$ $10$ -cent coins. This issue is resolved from $N = 35$ to $39$ , as the greedy algorithm can now select $25 + 10$ -cent coins to match the optimal solution.
From $N = 40$ to $44$ , a similar problem occurs again. The greedy algorithm selects $25 + 10 + 5 \times 1$ -cent coins to reach 40, while the optimal solution would use 4 $10$ -cent coins.
The problem occurs again from $N = 55$ to $59$ , where $50 + 5 \times 1$ is not as good as using $25 + 3 \times 10$ , and it is resolved at $N = 60$ . From $N = 65$ to $69$ , a similar issue arises, as $25 \times 2 + 10 + 5 \times 1$ is not as optimal as $25 + 4 \times 10$ to approach 65.
We observe that this issue repeats in cycles of $25$ numbers, with $10$ of the $25$ numbers in each cycle not working. The cycle starts at $30$ , and the next cycle will start $25$ numbers later, at $55$ , then $80$ , and so on, continuing until $980$ – $1005$ for the last cycle.
The total number of cycles is given by:
\[\frac{955 - 30}{25} + 1 = 38,\]
and each cycle contains $10$ problematic numbers. Therefore, the total number of problematic numbers is:
\[38 \times 10 = 380.\]
The cycle from $980$ to $1005$ has the problematic numbers from $980$ to $984$ and $990$ to $994$ , giving another $10$ problematic numbers.
Thus, the total number of unsuccessful numbers from $1$ to $1000$ inclusive is $390$ , and the desired count of successful numbers is:
\[1000 - 390 = \boxed{610}.\]
