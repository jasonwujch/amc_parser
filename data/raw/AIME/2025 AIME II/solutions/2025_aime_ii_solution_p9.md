# 2025 AIME II Problem 9

## Problem

There are $n$ values of $x$ in the interval $0<x<2\pi$ where $f(x)=\sin(7\pi\cdot\sin(5x))=0$ . For $t$ of these $n$ values of $x$ , the graph of $y=f(x)$ is tangent to the $x$ -axis. Find $n+t$ .

## Solution 1
For $\sin(7\pi\cdot\sin(5x))=0$ to happen, whatever is inside the function must be of form $k\pi$ . We then equate to have \begin{align*} 7\pi\cdot\sin(5x)=k\pi \\ \sin(5x)=\frac{k}{7} \\ \end{align*} We know that $-1\le \sin{5x} \le 1$ , so clearly $k$ takes all values $-7\le k \le 7$ . Since the graph of $\sin{5x}$ has 5 periods between $0$ and $360$ , each of the values $k=-6,-5,-4...-1,1,2...6$ give $10$ solutions each. $k=-7,7$ give $5$ solutions each and $k=0$ gives $9$ solutions (to verify this sketch a graph). Thus, $n=139$ .
We know that the function is tangent to the x-axis if it retains the same sign on both sides of the function. This is not true for points at $k=-6,-5,-4...4,5,6$ because one side will be positive and one will be negative. However this will happen if $k=-7,7$ because the sine function "bounces back" and goes over the same values again, and $t=10$ of these values exist. Thus, $n+t=\boxed{149}$ .

## Solution 2 (Calculus)
For $f(x)=0$ , we must have $7\pi\cdot\sin(5x)=k\pi$ for some integer $k$ . Then $\sin(5x)=\frac{k}{7}$ always satisfies the equation. Notice that on each period of $\sin(5x)$ , each $k\in\{-6,-5,\ldots,5,6\}$ is a $y$ -value at two distinct points, and each $k=\pm7$ is a $y$ -value at one point each. Thus each period has $13\cdot2+2\cdot1=28$ points satisfying the equation. Since the period is $\frac{2\pi}{5}$ and the domain has a length of $2\pi$ , we find that $5$ periods occur in our domain if we include $x=0,2\pi$ . Adding the case where $x=0$ , there are a total of $28\cdot5+1=141$ roots over $x\in[0,2\pi]$ . Subtracting the cases at $x=0$ and $x=2\pi$ yields $139$ total roots. This is our $n$ .
Next, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ ; using a hideous combination of chain rules we find that
\[f'(x)=35\pi\cos(5x)\cos(7\pi\sin(5x))=0\]
Thus, for a point to be tangent to the $x$ -axis, we must have either $\cos(5x)=0$ or $\cos(7\pi\sin(5x))=0$ . In the first case, we know that $\sin(5x)=\frac{k}{7}$ from earlier, so $\cos(5x)=\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{k}{7}\right)^2}=0$ . Then $\left(\frac{k}{7}\right)^2=1$ , so $k=\pm7$ . Recall that over each of the five periods, only one point will satisfy $k=7$ , and only one point will satisfy $k=-7$ . Thus there are $2\cdot5=10$ points in this case.
In the second case, we must have $\cos(7\pi\sin(5x))=0$ . Substituting $\sin(5x)=\frac{k}{7}$ yields $\cos(k\pi)=0$ . But this is impossible since $\cos(0)=1$ and $\cos(\pi)=-1$ , so there are no points in this case.
As a result, $t=10+0=10$ , so $n+t=139+10=\boxed{149}$ .
