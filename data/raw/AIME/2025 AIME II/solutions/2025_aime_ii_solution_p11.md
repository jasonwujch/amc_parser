# 2025 AIME II Problem 11

## Problem

Let $S$ be the set of vertices of a regular $24$ -gon. Find the number of ways to draw $12$ segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $S$ is an endpoint of exactly one of the $12$ segments.

## Solution
The segments we draw must be of equal length, corresponding to a specific step size $k$ (number of steps between vertices).
For each step size $k$ , we need to determine if it is possible to form a perfect matching (non-overlapping segments covering all vertices). The number of such perfect matchings depends on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $k$ and 24.
When choosing a step size $k$ , the 24-gon is decomposed into $\gcd(k, 24)$ cycles, each of length $\frac{24}{\gcd(k, 24)}$ . For a perfect matching to exist, each cycle must be of even length.
For each valid step size ( $k$ ):
If the cycle length is 2 (diameters), there is exactly 1 way to match the vertices.
For other even cycle lengths, each cycle contributes a factor of 2 to the number of perfect matchings.
( $k = 1$ ): $\gcd(1, 24) = 1$ , cycle length 24, 2 matchings.
( $k = 2$ ): $\gcd(2, 24) = 2$ , cycle length 12, $(2^2 = 4)$ matchings.
( $k = 3$ ): $\gcd(3, 24) = 3$ , cycle length 8, $(2^3 = 8)$ matchings.
( $k = 4$ ): $\gcd(4, 24) = 4$ , cycle length 6, $(2^4 = 16)$ matchings.
( $k = 5$ ): $\gcd(5, 24) = 1$ , cycle length 24, 2 matchings.
( $k = 6$ ): $\gcd(6, 24) = 6$ , cycle length 4, $(2^6 = 64)$ matchings.
( $k = 7$ ): $\gcd(7, 24) = 1$ , cycle length 24, 2 matchings.
( $k = 8$ ): $\gcd(8, 24) = 8$ , cycle length 3 (invalid, no matchings).
( $k = 9$ ): $\gcd(9, 24) = 3$ , cycle length 8, $(2^3 = 8)$ matchings.
( $k = 10$ ): $\gcd(10, 24) = 2$ , cycle length 12, $(2^2 = 4)$ matchings.
( $k = 11$ ): $\gcd(11, 24) = 1$ , cycle length 24, 2 matchings.
( $k = 12$ ): $\gcd(12, 24) = 12$ , cycle length 2, 1 matching.
Summing these values: $2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 2 + 64 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = \boxed{113}$ .
