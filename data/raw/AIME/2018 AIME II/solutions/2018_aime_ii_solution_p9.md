## Problem

Octagon $ABCDEFGH$ with side lengths $AB = CD = EF = GH = 10$ and $BC = DE = FG = HA = 11$ is formed by removing 6-8-10 triangles from the corners of a $23$ $\times$ $27$ rectangle with side $\overline{AH}$ on a short side of the rectangle, as shown. Let $J$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AH}$ , and partition the octagon into 7 triangles by drawing segments $\overline{JB}$ , $\overline{JC}$ , $\overline{JD}$ , $\overline{JE}$ , $\overline{JF}$ , and $\overline{JG}$ . Find the area of the convex polygon whose vertices are the centroids of these 7 triangles.

## Solution 1 (Massive Shoelace)
We represent octagon $ABCDEFGH$ in the coordinate plane with the upper left corner of the rectangle being the origin. Then it follows that $A=(0,-6), B=(8, 0), C=(19,0), D=(27, -6), E=(27, -17), F=(19, -23), G=(8, -23), H=(0, -17), J=(0, -\frac{23}{2})$ . Recall that the centroid is $\frac{1}{3}$ way up each median in the triangle. Thus, we can find the centroids easily by finding the midpoint of the side opposite of point $J$ . Furthermore, we can take advantage of the reflective symmetry across the line parallel to $BC$ going through $J$ by dealing with less coordinates and ommiting the $\frac{1}{2}$ in the shoelace formula.
By doing some basic algebra, we find that the coordinates of the centroids of $\bigtriangleup JAB, \bigtriangleup JBC, \bigtriangleup JCD, \bigtriangleup JDE$ are $\left(\frac{8}{3}, -\frac{35}{6}\right), \left(9, -\frac{23}{6}\right), \left(\frac{46}{3}, -\frac{35}{6}\right),$ and $\left(18, -\frac{23}{2}\right)$ , respectively. We'll have to throw in the projection of the centroid of $\bigtriangleup JAB$ to the line of reflection to apply shoelace, and that point is $\left( \frac{8}{3}, -\frac{23}{2}\right)$
Finally, applying Shoelace, we get: $\left|\left(\frac{8}{3}\cdot (-\frac{23}{6})+9\cdot (-\frac{35}{6})+\frac{46}{3}\cdot (-\frac{23}{2})+18\cdot (\frac{-23}{2})+\frac{8}{3}\cdot (-\frac{35}{6})\right) - \left((-\frac{35}{6}\cdot 9) +\\(-\frac{23}{6}\cdot \frac{46}{3})+ (-\frac{35}{6}\cdot 18)+(\frac{-23}{2}\cdot \frac{8}{3})+(-\frac{23}{2}\cdot \frac{8}{3})\right)\right|$ $=\left|\left(-\frac{92}{9}-\frac{105}{2}-\frac{529}{3}-207-\frac{140}{9}\right)-\left(-\frac{105}{2}-\frac{529}{9}-105-\frac{92}{3}-\frac{92}{3}\right)\right|$ $=\left|-\frac{232}{9}-\frac{1373}{6}-207+\frac{529}{9}+\frac{184}{3}+105+\frac{105}{2}\right|$ $=\left|\frac{297}{9}-\frac{690}{6}-102\right|=\left| 33-115-102\right|=\left|-184\right|=\boxed{184}$
Solution by ktong
note: for a slightly simpler calculation, notice that the heptagon can be divided into two trapezoids of equal area and a small triangle.

## Solution 2 (Homothety)
Draw the heptagon whose vertices are the midpoints of octagon $ABCDEFGH$ except $J$ . We have a homothety since:
1. $J$ passes through corresponding vertices of the two heptagons.
2. By centroid properties, our ratio between the sidelengths is $\frac{2}{3},$ and their area ratio is hence $\frac{4}{9}.$
Compute the area of the large heptagon by dividing into two congruent trapezoids and a triangle. The area of each trapezoid is \[= \frac{1}{2}(17+23)\cdot \frac{19}{2}=190.\] The area of each triangle is \[= \frac{1}{2}\cdot 17\cdot 4=34.\]
Hence, the area of the large heptagon is \[2\cdot 190+34=414.\] Then, from our homothety, the area of the required heptagon is \[\frac{4}{9}\cdot 414=\boxed{184}.\] ~novus677
### Supplement
Note that we use $17.$ A proof of this is as follows:
- First, note that the shaded triangles are 6-8-10 triangles. Because the homothety is defined on the midpoints of the sides of the octagon, the smaller triangle created by that midpoint and the surrounding rectangle has sides 3-4-5. Thus, the sidelength of the octagon (17) is just 23-2*3=17.

## Solution 3 (Less bashy finish than shoelace)
Instead of bashing shoelace, we can find a clever way to calculate the area of the heptagon without using homothety. By connecting the centroids of $\bigtriangleup JAB, \bigtriangleup JCD$ , $\bigtriangleup JHG, \bigtriangleup JFE$ , and $\bigtriangleup JFE, \bigtriangleup JCD$ . This will give us three triangles and a rectangle. The area of the rectangle is $\frac{34}{3}*\frac{38}{3}$ , the top and bottom triangles each give $\frac{38}{3}*2*\frac{1}{2}$ , and the triangle on the right yields $\frac{34}{3}*\frac{8}{3}*\frac{1}{2}$ by using $\frac{bh}{2}$ . Summing them up, we get $\frac{1656}{9}$ , which gives us $\boxed{184}$ . ~boppitybobii
