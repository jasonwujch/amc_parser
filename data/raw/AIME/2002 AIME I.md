Problem 1
Many states use a sequence of three letters followed by a sequence of three digits as their standard license-plate pattern. Given that each three-letter three-digit arrangement is equally likely, the probability that such a license plate will contain at least one palindrome (a three-letter arrangement or a three-digit arrangement that reads the same left-to-right as it does right-to-left) is $m/n$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .

Problem 2
The diagram shows twenty congruent circles arranged in three rows and enclosed in a rectangle. The circles are tangent to one another and to the sides of the rectangle as shown in the diagram. The ratio of the longer dimension of the rectangle to the shorter dimension can be written as $\frac{1}{2}\left(\sqrt{p}-q\right)$ , where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers. Find $p+q$ .

Problem 3
Jane is 25 years old. Dick is older than Jane. In $n$ years, where $n$ is a positive integer, Dick's age and Jane's age will both be two-digit numbers and will have the property that Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age. Let $d$ be Dick's present age. How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(d,n)$ are possible?

Problem 9
Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence. Harold starts with the first picket and paints every $h$ th picket; Tanya starts with the second picket and paints every $t$ th picket; and Ulysses starts with the third picket and paints every $u$ th picket. Call the positive integer $100h+10t+u$ $\textit{paintable}$ when the triple $(h,t,u)$ of positive integers results in every picket being painted exactly once. Find the sum of all the paintable integers.
