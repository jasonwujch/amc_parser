Problem 5
Each of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is $25.$ One marble is taken out of each box randomly. The probability that both marbles are black is $\frac{27}{50},$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n$ ?

Solution

Problem 13
In the middle of a vast prairie, a firetruck is stationed at the intersection of two perpendicular straight highways. The truck travels at $50$ miles per hour along the highways and at $14$ miles per hour across the prairie. Consider the set of points that can be reached by the firetruck within six minutes. The area of this region is $\frac{m}{n}$ square miles, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$ .

Problem 14
In triangle $ABC,$ it is given that angles $B$ and $C$ are congruent. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie on $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{AB},$ respectively, so that $AP = PQ = QB = BC.$ Angle $ACB$ is $r$ times as large as angle $APQ,$ where $r$ is a positive real number. Find $\lfloor 1000r \rfloor$ .

Solution

Problem 15
A stack of $2000$ cards is labelled with the integers from $1$ to $2000,$ with different integers on different cards. The cards in the stack are not in numerical order. The top card is removed from the stack and placed on the table, and the next card is moved to the bottom of the stack. The new top card is removed from the stack and placed on the table, to the right of the card already there, and the next card in the stack is moved to the bottom of the stack. The process - placing the top card to the right of the cards already on the table and moving the next card in the stack to the bottom of the stack - is repeated until all cards are on the table. It is found that, reading from left to right, the labels on the cards are now in ascending order: $1,2,3,\ldots,1999,2000.$ In the original stack of cards, how many cards were above the card labeled $1999$ ?
