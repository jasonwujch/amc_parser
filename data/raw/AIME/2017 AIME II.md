Problem 2
Teams $T_1$ , $T_2$ , $T_3$ , and $T_4$ are in the playoffs. In the semifinal matches, $T_1$ plays $T_4$ , and $T_2$ plays $T_3$ . The winners of those two matches will play each other in the final match to determine the champion. When $T_i$ plays $T_j$ , the probability that $T_i$ wins is $\frac{i}{i+j}$ , and the outcomes of all the matches are independent. The probability that $T_4$ will be the champion is $\frac{p}{q}$ , where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$ .

Problem 9
A special deck of cards contains $49$ cards, each labeled with a number from $1$ to $7$ and colored with one of seven colors. Each number-color combination appears on exactly one card. Sharon will select a set of eight cards from the deck at random. Given that she gets at least one card of each color and at least one card with each number, the probability that Sharon can discard one of her cards and $\textit{still}$ have at least one card of each color and at least one card with each number is $\frac{p}{q}$ , where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.

Problem 11
Five towns are connected by a system of roads. There is exactly one road connecting each pair of towns.

Problem 12
Circle $C_0$ has radius $1$ , and the point $A_0$ is a point on the circle. Circle $C_1$ has radius $r<1$ and is internally tangent to $C_0$ at point $A_0$ . Point $A_1$ lies on circle $C_1$ so that $A_1$ is located $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise from $A_0$ on $C_1$ . Circle $C_2$ has radius $r^2$ and is internally tangent to $C_1$ at point $A_1$ . In this way a sequence of circles $C_1,C_2,C_3,\ldots$ and a sequence of points on the circles $A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots$ are constructed, where circle $C_n$ has radius $r^n$ and is internally tangent to circle $C_{n-1}$ at point $A_{n-1}$ , and point $A_n$ lies on $C_n$ $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise from point $A_{n-1}$ , as shown in the figure below. There is one point $B$ inside all of these circles. When $r = \frac{11}{60}$ , the distance from the center $C_0$ to $B$ is $\frac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
