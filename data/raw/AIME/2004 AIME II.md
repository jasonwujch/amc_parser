Problem 1
A chord of a circle is perpendicular to a radius at the midpoint of the radius. The ratio of the area of the larger of the two regions into which the chord divides the circle to the smaller can be expressed in the form $\frac{a\pi+b\sqrt{c}}{d\pi-e\sqrt{f}},$ where $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$ are positive integers, $a$ and $e$ are relatively prime, and neither $c$ nor $f$ is divisible by the square of any prime. Find the remainder when the product $abcdef$ is divided by 1000.

Problem 5
In order to complete a large job, 1000 workers were hired, just enough to complete the job on schedule. All the workers stayed on the job while the first quarter of the work was done, so the first quarter of the work was completed on schedule. Then 100 workers were laid off, so the second quarter of the work was completed behind schedule. Then an additional 100 workers were laid off, so the third quarter of the work was completed still further behind schedule. Given that all workers work at the same rate, what is the minimum number of additional workers, beyond the 800 workers still on the job at the end of the third quarter, that must be hired after three-quarters of the work has been completed so that the entire project can be completed on schedule or before?

Solution

Problem 6
Three clever monkeys divide a pile of bananas. The first monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The second monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas from the pile, keeps one-twelfth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. Given that each monkey receives a whole number of bananas whenever the bananas are divided, and the numbers of bananas the first, second, and third monkeys have at the end of the process are in the ratio $3: 2: 1,$ what is the least possible total for the number of bananas?

Problem 9
A sequence of positive integers with $a_1=1$ and $a_9+a_{10}=646$ is formed so that the first three terms are in geometric progression, the second, third, and fourth terms are in arithmetic progression, and, in general, for all $n\ge1,$ the terms $a_{2n-1}, a_{2n}, a_{2n+1}$ are in geometric progression, and the terms $a_{2n}, a_{2n+1},$ and $a_{2n+2}$ are in arithmetic progression. Let $a_n$ be the greatest term in this sequence that is less than 1000. Find $n+a_n.$

A right circular cone has a base with radius 600 and height $200\sqrt{7}.$ A fly starts at a point on the surface of the cone whose distance from the vertex of the cone is 125, and crawls along the surface of the cone to a point on the exact opposite side of the cone whose distance from the vertex is $375\sqrt{2}.$ Find the least distance that the fly could have crawled.

Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid, whose dimensions are $AB = 6, BC=5=DA,$ and $CD=4.$ Draw circles of radius 3 centered at $A$ and $B$ and circles of radius 2 centered at $C$ and $D.$ A circle contained within the trapezoid is tangent to all four of these circles.

Problem 14
Consider a string of $n$ $7$ 's, $7777\cdots77,$ into which $+$ signs are inserted to produce an arithmetic expression. For example, $7+77+777+7+7=875$ could be obtained from eight $7$ 's in this way. For how many values of $n$ is it possible to insert $+$ signs so that the resulting expression has value $7000$ ?

Solution

Problem 15
A long thin strip of paper is 1024 units in length, 1 unit in width, and is divided into 1024 unit squares. The paper is folded in half repeatedly. For the first fold, the right end of the paper is folded over to coincide with and lie on top of the left end. The result is a 512 by 1 strip of double thickness. Next, the right end of this strip is folded over to coincide with and lie on top of the left end, resulting in a 256 by 1 strip of quadruple thickness. This process is repeated 8 more times. After the last fold, the strip has become a stack of 1024 unit squares. How many of these squares lie below the square that was originally the 942nd square counting from the left?
