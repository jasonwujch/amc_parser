# 2011 AIME II Problem 1

## Problem

Gary purchased a large beverage, but only drank $m/n$ of it, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. If he had purchased half as much and drunk twice as much, he would have wasted only $2/9$ as much beverage. Find $m+n$ .

## Solution
Let $x$ be the fraction consumed, then $(1-x)$ is the fraction wasted. We have $\frac{1}{2} - 2x =\frac{2}{9} (1-x)$ , or $9 - 36x = 4 - 4x$ , or $32x = 5$ or $x = 5/32$ . Therefore, $m + n = 5 + 32 = \boxed{037}$ .

## Solution 2
WLOG, Gary purchased \( n \) liters and consumed \( m \) liters. After this, he purchased \( \frac{n}{2} \) liters, and consumed \( 2m \) liters. He originally wasted \( n-m \) liters, but now he wasted \( \frac{n}{2} - 2m \). \[ \frac{n}{2} - 2m = \frac{4}{18} \cdot (n-m) \] \[ 9n - 36m = 4n - 4m \implies 5n = 32m \implies \frac{m}{n} = \frac{5}{32}. \]
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{37}$ ~idk123456
