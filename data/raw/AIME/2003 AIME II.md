Solution

Problem 4

Solution

Problem 5
A cylindrical log has diameter $12$ inches. A wedge is cut from the log by making two planar cuts that go entirely through the log. The first is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and the plane of the second cut forms a $45^\circ$ angle with the plane of the first cut. The intersection of these two planes has exactly one point in common with the log. The number of cubic inches in the wedge can be expressed as $n\pi$ , where n is a positive integer. Find $n$ .

Solution

Problem 9
Consider the polynomials $P(x) = x^{6} - x^{5} - x^{3} - x^{2} - x$ and $Q(x) = x^{4} - x^{3} - x^{2} - 1.$ Given that $z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},$ and $z_{4}$ are the roots of $Q(x) = 0,$ find $P(z_{1}) + P(z_{2}) + P(z_{3}) + P(z_{4}).$

Problem 10
Two positive integers differ by $60.$ The sum of their square roots is the square root of an integer that is not a perfect square. What is the maximum possible sum of the two integers?

Solution

Problem 11
Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $AC = 7,$ $BC = 24,$ and right angle at $C.$ Point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ and $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$ so that $AD = BD = 15.$ Given that the area of triangle $CDM$ may be expressed as $\frac {m\sqrt {n}}{p},$ where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m + n + p.$

Solution

Problem 12
The members of a distinguished committee were choosing a president, and each member gave one vote to one of the $27$ candidates. For each candidate, the exact percentage of votes the candidate got was smaller by at least $1$ than the number of votes for that candidate. What is the smallest possible number of members of the committee?

Solution

Problem 13
A bug starts at a vertex of an equilateral triangle. On each move, it randomly selects one of the two vertices where it is not currently located, and crawls along a side of the triangle to that vertex. Given that the probability that the bug moves to its starting vertex on its tenth move is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m + n.$

Solution

Problem 14
Let $A = (0,0)$ and $B = (b,2)$ be points on the coordinate plane. Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex equilateral hexagon such that $\angle FAB = 120^\circ,$ $\overline{AB}\parallel \overline{DE},$ $\overline{BC}\parallel \overline{EF,}$ $\overline{CD}\parallel \overline{FA},$ and the y-coordinates of its vertices are distinct elements of the set $\{0,2,4,6,8,10\}.$ The area of the hexagon can be written in the form $m\sqrt {n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and n is not divisible by the square of any prime.
