# 2003 AIME I Problem 1

## Problem

Given that

where $k$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is as large as possible, find $k + n.$

## Solution
Note that \[{{\left((3!)!\right)!}\over{3!}}= {{(6!)!}\over{6}}={{720!}\over6}={{720\cdot719!}\over6}=120\cdot719!.\] Because $120\cdot719!<720!$ , we can conclude that $n < 720$ . Thus, the maximum value of $n$ is $719$ . The requested value of $k+n$ is therefore $120+719=\boxed{839}$ .
