Problem 1
The numbers of apples growing on each of six apple trees form an arithmetic sequence where the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees is double the least number of apples growing on any of the six trees. The total number of apples growing on all six trees is $990.$ Find the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees.

Solution

Problem 2
Recall that a palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. Find the greatest integer less than $1000$ that is a palindrome both when written in base ten and when written in base eight, such as $292 = 444_{\text{eight}}.$

Problem 5
Let $S$ be the set of all positive rational numbers $r$ such that when the two numbers $r$ and $55r$ are written as fractions in lowest terms, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is the same as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other fraction.

Problem 7
Each vertex of a regular dodecagon ( $12$ -gon) is to be colored either red or blue, and thus there are $2^{12}$ possible colorings. Find the number of these colorings with the property that no four vertices colored the same color are the four vertices of a rectangle.
