Problem 3
Nine people sit down for dinner where there are three choices of meals. Three people order the beef meal, three order the chicken meal, and three order the fish meal. The waiter serves the nine meals in random order. Find the number of ways in which the waiter could serve the meal types to the nine people so that exactly one person receives the type of meal ordered by that person.

Problem 4
Butch and Sundance need to get out of Dodge. To travel as quickly as possible, each alternates walking and riding their only horse, Sparky, as follows. Butch begins by walking while Sundance rides. When Sundance reaches the first of the hitching posts that are conveniently located at one-mile intervals along their route, he ties Sparky to the post and begins walking. When Butch reaches Sparky, he rides until he passes Sundance, then leaves Sparky at the next hitching post and resumes walking, and they continue in this manner. Sparky, Butch, and Sundance walk at $6,$ $4,$ and $2.5$ miles per hour, respectively. The first time Butch and Sundance meet at a milepost, they are $n$ miles from Dodge, and they have been traveling for $t$ minutes. Find $n + t$ .

Problem 7
At each of the sixteen circles in the network below stands a student. A total of $3360$ coins are distributed among the sixteen students. All at once, all students give away all their coins by passing an equal number of coins to each of their neighbors in the network. After the trade, all students have the same number of coins as they started with. Find the number of coins the student standing at the center circle had originally.

Problem 8
Cube $ABCDEFGH,$ labeled as shown below, has edge length $1$ and is cut by a plane passing through vertex $D$ and the midpoints $M$ and $N$ of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CG}$ respectively.

Problem 11
A frog begins at $P_0 = (0,0)$ and makes a sequence of jumps according to the following rule: from $P_n = (x_n, y_n),$ the frog jumps to $P_{n+1},$ which may be any of the points $(x_n + 7, y_n + 2),$ $(x_n + 2, y_n + 7),$ $(x_n - 5, y_n - 10),$ or $(x_n - 10, y_n - 5).$ There are $M$ points $(x, y)$ with $|x| + |y| \le 100$ that can be reached by a sequence of such jumps. Find the remainder when $M$ is divided by $1000.$
