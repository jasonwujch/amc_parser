# 2016 AIME I Problem 1

## Problem

For $-1<r<1$ , let $S(r)$ denote the sum of the geometric series \[12+12r+12r^2+12r^3+\cdots .\] Let $a$ between $-1$ and $1$ satisfy $S(a)S(-a)=2016$ . Find $S(a)+S(-a)$ .

## Solution
The sum of an infinite geometric series is $\frac{a}{1-r}\rightarrow \frac{12}{1\mp a}$ . The product $S(a)S(-a)=\frac{144}{1-a^2}=2016$ . $\frac{12}{1-a}+\frac{12}{1+a}=\frac{24}{1-a^2}$ , so the answer is $\frac{2016}{6}=\boxed{336}$ .
