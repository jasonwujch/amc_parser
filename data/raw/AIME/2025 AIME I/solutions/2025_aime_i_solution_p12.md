## Problem

The set of points in $3$ -dimensional coordinate space that lie in the plane $x+y+z=75$ whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities \[x-yz<y-zx<z-xy\] forms three disjoint convex regions. Exactly one of those regions has finite area. The area of this finite region can be expressed in the form $a\sqrt{b},$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b.$

## Solution 1
Rewriting we have $z=75-x-y.$
From the inequality $x-yz<y-zx$ we can rewrite to get, \[x-y(75-x-y)< y-x(75-x-y).\] \[76x-76y+y^2-x^2<0.\] \[(76+x+y)(x-y)<0.\]
Similarly from the inequality $y-zx<z-xy$ we rewrite to get, \[y-x(75-x-y)<(75-x-y)-xy.\] \[2y + 2xy + x^2 - 74x - 75 < 0.\] \[(x + 1)(2y + x - 75) < 0.\] Our next step is a visual which can be seen by roughly graphing the two inequalities. The first inequality is similar to a bow tie(you have to graph to see it lol) with bounds of $x-y=0$ and $76+x+y=0.$ The second one is a bow tie with edges of $x+1=0$ and $2y+x-75=0.$ Here is the region of our solutions. [asy] import graph; size(400, 400); real xmin = -250, xmax = 250; real ymin = -150, ymax = 150; draw((xmin,0)--(xmax,0), black+0.8bp, Arrow); draw((0,ymin)--(0,ymax), black+0.8bp, Arrow); pair A = (-38, -38), B = (-10, -10), C = (-227, 151), D = (-10, 85/2), E = (25, 25); path L1 = (xmin, xmin)--(xmax, xmax); path L2 = (xmin, -76-xmin)--(xmax, -76-xmax); path L3 = ((-10, ymin)--(-10, ymax)); path L4 = (xmin, (75-xmin)/2)--(xmax, (75-xmax)/2); fill(B--D--E--cycle, lightgreen); draw(L1, blue); draw(L2, blue); draw(L3, red); draw(L4, red); dot(A, black); label("$(-38,-38)$", A, SW); dot(B, black); label("$(-1,-1)$", B, SE); dot(C, black); label("$(-227,151)$", C, NW); dot(D, black); label("$(-1,38)$", D, NE); dot(E, black); label("$(25,25)$", E, SE); [/asy] It is simple to find the intersections of those which are $(-1,38,38),(25,25,25)$ and $(-1,-1,77).$ The sidelengths of this triangle are $39\sqrt{2},26\sqrt{6},13\sqrt{6}$ which is a $30-60-90$ gives us an area of \[\frac{1}{2}(39\sqrt{2})(13\sqrt{6})=507\sqrt{3}\implies\boxed{510}.\]

## Solution 2
Consider $x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$ . From $x-yz<y-zx$ , we find $z(y-x)>x-y$ . Thus, if $x>y$ , then $z<-1$ , and if $x<y$ , then $z>-1$ . Similarly, taking another pair of the inequalities yields $y>-1$ when $z>x$ and $y<-1$ when $x>z$ . Finally, taking the third pair yields $x>-1$ if $z>y$ and $x<-1$ if $z<y$ .
Consider the first two resultant pairs of inequalities. Taking them pairwise (one from the first set and one from the second set) results in four cases:
1. Combining $z<-1$ if $x>y$ and $y>-1$ if $z>x$ yields $-1>z>x>y>-1$ , a contradiction.
2. Combining $z<-1$ if $x>y$ and $y<-1$ if $z<x$ yields $x,-1>y,z$ .
3. Combining $z>-1$ if $x<y$ and $y>-1$ if $z>x$ yields $y,z>-1,x$ .
4. Combining $z>-1$ if $x<y$ and $y<-1$ if $z<x$ yields $-1>y>x>z>-1$ , a contradiction.
Now we have only two satisfactory inequalities. We now consider the third pair of inequalities ( $x>-1$ if $z>y$ and $x<-1$ if $z<y$ ). Taking the two sets pairwise:
1. Combining $x,-1>y,z$ and $x>-1$ if $z>y$ yields $x>-1>z>y$ . Consider some valid $x,y,z$ that satisfy $x+y+z=75$ and $x>-1>z>y$ . We can infinitely increase $x$ while decreasing $y$ by the same amount, leading to another valid triple, so this case is infinite and we do not consider this case (for instance, if $x=100,y=-13,z=-12$ , then $x=100+a,y=-13-a,z=-12$ is a valid triple for all nonnegative $a$ ).
2. Combining $y,z>-1,x$ and $x>-1$ if $z>y$ yields $z>y>x>-1$ . This case is finite due to the lower bound.
3. Combining $x,-1>y,z$ and $x<-1$ if $z<y$ yields $-1>x>y>z$ . There are no possible solutions since $x,y,z$ are negative from this inequality, but at least one must be positive to satisfy $x+y+z=75$ , a contradiction.
4. Combining $y,z>-1,x$ and $x<-1$ if $z<y$ yields $y>z>-1>x$ . By the same argument as in Case 1, this is an infinite case.
Thus we are tasked with finding the area of the figure formed by all triples $x,y,z$ satisfying $x+y+z=75$ and $z>y>x>-1$ . We consider edge cases, so we maximize each variable by the largest amount possible to find three triples $(77,-1,-1),(38,38,-1),(25,25,25)$ . We assume that these are the only edge cases (so the figure forms a triangle), and we can use the Distance formula . We find that the three side lengths of our triangle are $39\sqrt{2},13\sqrt{6},26\sqrt{6}$ . These side lengths just so happen to form a $30-60-90$ triangle with legs $13\sqrt{6}$ and $39\sqrt{2}$ , so the area of the triangle is
\[\frac{1}{2}\cdot13\sqrt{6}\cdot39\sqrt{2}=507\sqrt{3}\]
Thus the answer is $507+3=\boxed{510}$ . ~eevee9406

## Solution 3
Decomposing the inequality chain: \[x-yz<y-zx \quad \text{and} \quad y-zx<z-xy\] which is equivalent to \[(x-y)(z+1)<0 \quad \text{and} \quad (y-z)(x+1)<0\] Substituting $z$ with $z=75-x-y$ and simplifying yields \[(x-y)(x+y-76)>0 \quad \text{and} \quad (x+2y-75)(x+1)<0\] See that the solution to the first inequality is \[x-y>0, \, x+y-76>0 \quad \text{(I)} \quad \text{or} \quad x-y<0, \, x+y-76<0 \quad \text{(II)}\] Applying a similar method results in the solution to the second: \[x+2y-75>0, \, x+1<0 \quad \text{(III)} \quad \text{or} \quad x+2y-75<0, \, x+1>0 \quad \text{(IV)}\] Trying each grouping (i.e. let $\text{(I)}$ and $\text{(III)}$ , $\text{(I)}$ and $\text{(IV)}$ , $\text{(II)}$ and $\text{(III)}$ , or $\text{(II)}$ and $\text{(IV)}$ be satisfied at the same time) and graphing shows that when $\text{(II)}$ and $\text{(IV)}$ are both satisfied, a triangle whose vertices are $(-1,38)$ , $(-1,-1)$ , and $(25,25)$ is formed. Further calculations show that the area of the triangle is $507$ . However, this is not the final answer. We have projected the original shape to the $xy$ -plane by substituting $z$ . We know that for a surface defined by the equation $z=f(x,y)$ , the area element $dS$ for this surface is given by \[dS=\sqrt{1+(f_x)^2+(f_y)^2}dxdy\] where $f_x$ and $f_y$ are the partial derivatives of the function $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ . For the plane $x+y+z=75$ where $f(x,y)=75-x-y$ , computation gives \[f_x=-1, f_y=-1\] Substituting these into the original equation to get \[dS=\sqrt{3}dxdy\] This implies that to find the area of the original shape, we have to multiply the area of its projection on the $xy$ -plane by $\sqrt{3}$ . Therefore, the area of the original shape is $507\sqrt{3}$ , with final answer $\boxed{510}$ .

This is the real graph of the 3D space in coordinates. The area in BLUE is the space that satisfied the conditions, and it is 1/6 of a regular triangle.
