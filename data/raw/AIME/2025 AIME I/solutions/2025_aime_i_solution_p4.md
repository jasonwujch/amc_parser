## Solution 1
We begin by factoring, $12x^2-xy-6y^2=(3x+2y)(4x-3y)=0.$ Since the RHS is $0$ we have two options,
$\underline{\text{Case 1:}}\text{ } 3x+2y = 0$
In this case we have, $y=\frac{-3x}{2}.$ Using the bounding on $y$ we have, \[-100\le\frac{-3x}{2}\le 100.\] \[\frac{200}{3}\ge x \ge \frac{-200}{3}.\] In addition in order for $y$ to be integer $2 | x,$ so we substitute $x=2k.$ \[\frac{200}{3}\ge 2k \ge \frac{-200}{3}.\] \[\frac{100}{3}\ge k \ge \frac{-100}{3}.\] From this we have solutions starting from $-33$ to $33$ which is $67$ solutions.
$\underline{\text{Case 2: }}\text{ } 4x-3y = 0$
On the other hand, we have, $y=\frac{4x}{3}.$ From bounds we have, \[-100\le\frac{4x}{3}\le 100.\] \[-75 \le x \le 75.\] In this case, for $y$ to be integer $3 | x,$ so we substitute $x=3t.$ \[-75 \le 3t \le 75.\] \[-25 \le t \le 25.\] This gives us $51$ solutions.
Finally we overcount one case which is the intersection of the $2$ lines or the point $(0,0).$ Therefore our answer is $67+51-1=\boxed{117}$

## Solution 2
First, notice that $(0,0)$ is a solution.
Divide the equation by $y^2$ , getting $12(\frac{x}{y})^2-\frac{x}{y}-6 = 0$ . (We can ignore the $y=0$ case for now.) Let $a = \frac{x}{y}$ . We now have $12a^2-a-6=0$ . Factoring, we get $(4a-3)(3a+2) = 0$ . Therefore, the graph is satisfied when $4a=3$ or $3a=-2$ . Substituting $\frac{x}{y} = a$ back into the equations, we get $4x=3y$ or $3x=-2y$ .
Remember that both $x$ and $y$ are bounded by $-100$ and $100$ , inclusive. For $4x=3y$ , the solutions are $(-75,-100), (-72,-96), (-69, -92), \dots, (72,96), (75,100)$ . Remember to not count the $x=y=0$ case for now. There are $25$ positive solutions and $25$ negative solutions for a total of $50$ .
For $3x-2y$ , we do something similar. The solutions are $(-66,99), (-64,96), \dots, (64, -96), (66, -99)$ . There are $33$ solutions when $x$ is positive and $33$ solutions when $x$ is negative, for a total of $66$ .
Now we can count the edge case of $(0,0)$ . The answer is therefore $50+66+1 = \boxed{117}$ .

## Solution 3
You can use the quadratic formula for this equation: $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$ ; Although this solution may seem to be misleading, it works! What we are doing is considering the quadratic with respect to $1$ , where $12x^2$ is the coefficient of $1^2$ , $-xy$ is the coefficient of $1$ , and $-6y^2$ is the constant term.
You get: \[\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
\[\frac{xy \pm \sqrt{x^2 y^2 + (12\cdot6\cdot4\cdot x^2 \cdot y^2)}}{24x^2}\]
\[= \frac{xy \pm\sqrt{289x^2 y^2}}{24x^2}\]
\[= \frac{18xy}{24x^2}\text{, and }\frac{-16xy}{24x^2}\]
Rather than putting this equation as zero, the numerators and denominators must be equal [EDIT: We set each value equal to one because the quadratic is taken with respect to the root $1$ ]. These two equations simplify to:
\[3y = 4x;\] \[-2y = 3x;\]
As $x$ and $y$ are between $-100$ and $100$ , for the first equation, $x$ can be from $[-75,75]$ , but $x$ must be a multiple of $3$ , so there are:
$((75+75)/3) + 1 = 51$ solutions for this case.
For \[-2y = 3x:\]
$x$ can be between $[-66, 66]$ , but $x$ has to be a multiple of $2$ .
Therefore, there are $(66+66)/2 + 1 = 67$ solutions for this case.
However, the one overlap would be $x = 0$ , because y would be $0$ in both solutions.
Therefore, the answer is $51+67-1 = \boxed{117}.$
