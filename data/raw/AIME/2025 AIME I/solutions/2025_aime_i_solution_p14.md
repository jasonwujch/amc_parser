## Problem

Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon with $AB=14,$ $BC=7,$ $CD=24,$ $DE=13,$ $EA=26,$ and $\angle B=\angle E=60^{\circ}.$ For each point $X$ in the plane, define $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX+EX.$ The least possible value of $f(X)$ can be expressed as $m+n\sqrt{p},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p.$

## Solution 1
Assume $AX=a$ , $BX=b$ , $CX=c$ , $DX=d$ , $EX=e$ , by Ptolemy inequality we have $a+2d\geq \sqrt{3}XE; a+2c\geq \sqrt{3}BX$ , and as we are minimizing the value of the LHS, we want the inequality reached; this happens when both quadrilaterals $CXAB$ and $AXDE$ are concyclic. We notice that we have right angles $\angle{BXA}=\angle{BCA}$ and $\angle{EDA}=\angle{EXA}$ as they both subtend a diameter of circles by noticing that we have formed Pythagorean triples (along with being told that $\angle{B}=\angle{E}=60^{\circ}$ . And so, since we have supplementary angles, $B$ , $X$ , and $E$ are collinear. Thus, we add up the two equalities to get $2a+2c+2d=\sqrt{3}(XE+BX)$ , or $a+c+d=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(BE)$ . Thus we want to find $a+b+c+d+e=(1+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})BE$ .
By Law of Cosines, we know that $\cos(\angle{DAC})=\frac{1}{7}$ , and since $\angle{CAB}=\angle{DAE}=30^{\circ}$ , we know $\cos(\angle{EAB})=cos(\angle{CAB}+\angle{DAE}+\arccos(\frac{1}{7}))=cos(60^{\circ}+\arccos(\frac{1}{7}))$ , which we find with the cosine angle addition formula and the fact that $\sin(\arccos(\frac{1}{7}))=\sqrt{1-(\frac{1}{7})^2}$ . Then, once again with Law of Cosines, we find that $BE=38$ , and thus the minimum of $a+b+c+d+e$ , or $(1+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})BE$ , is $38+19\sqrt{3}\implies\boxed{060}$ .

## Solution 2
[asy] size(10cm); import math; import geometry; import olympiad; point A,B,C,D,F,P,X; A=(0,-7sqrt(3)); B=(-7,0); C=(0,0); D=(156/7,-36sqrt(3)/7); F=(169/7,-88sqrt(3)/7); P=(132/7,60sqrt(3)/7); X=(8580/2527,-10604sqrt(3)/2527); draw(A--B--C--P--D--F--A--C--D--A--P); draw(B--F); draw(circumcircle(A,B,C)); draw(circumcircle(A,D,F)); draw(circumcircle(C,P,D)); draw(C--X--D); label("A",A,SE); label("B",B,W); label("C",C,NW); label("P",P,N); label("D",D,E); label("E",F,SE); label("X",X,E); [/asy] Firstly, note that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ADE$ are just 30-60-90 triangles. Let $X$ be the Fermat point of $\triangle ACD$ , with motivation stemming from considering the pentagon as $\triangle ACD$ with the two 30-60-90 extensions. Note that $AX+CX+DX$ is minimized at this point when $\angle AXC=\angle CXD=\angle AXD=120^{\circ}$ . Because we have $\angle ABC=\angle AED=60^{\circ}$ , then $ABCX$ and $AXDE$ are both cyclic. Then we have $\angle AXE=\angle ADE=90^{\circ}$ and $\angle BXA=\angle BCA=90^{\circ}$ . Then it turns out that we actually have $\angle BXE=90^{\circ}+90^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$ , implying that $B$ , $X$ and $E$ are collinear. Now, by the triangle inequality, we must have $BX+XE\geq BE$ , with equality occurring when $X$ is on $BE$ . Thus $AX+CX+DX$ and $BX+EX$ are minimized, so this point $X$ is our desired point.
Firstly, we will find $BX+EX=BE$ . We have that $AC=7\sqrt{3}$ and $AD=13\sqrt{3}$ , so applying the Law of Cosines in $\triangle ACD$ , we get \[147+507-2(7\sqrt{3})(13\sqrt{3})\cos (\angle CAD)=576\implies \cos(\angle CAD)=\frac{1}{7}.\] It follows as a result that $\sin (\angle CAD)=\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}$ . Then we want to find $\cos (\angle BAE)$ . We can do this by seeing \[\cos (\angle BAE)=\cos (\angle CAD+60^{\circ})=\cos (\angle CAD)\cos 60^{\circ}-\sin (\angle CAD)\sin 60^{\circ}=\frac{1}{7}\cdot \frac{1}{2}-\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=-\frac{11}{14}.\] Applying the Law of Cosines again in $\triangle BAE$ , then because $AB=14$ and $AE=26$ , we have \[14^2+26^2-2(14)(26)\left (-\frac{11}{14}\right )=196+676-2\cdot 26\cdot (-11)=872+572=1444=BE^2,\] so it follows that $BE=38=BX+EX$ .
Now, we will find the value of $AX+CX+DX$ . Construct a point $P$ outside such that $\triangle CPD$ is equilateral, as shown. By property of fermat point, then $A$ , $X$ , and $P$ are collinear. Additionally, $\angle CXD=120^{\circ}$ , so $CPDX$ is cyclic. Applying Ptolemy's Theorem, we have that $(CX)(PD)+(CP)(XD)=(XP)(CD)$ . But since $\triangle CPD$ is equilateral, it follows that $CX+DX=PX$ . Then $AX+CX+DX=AX+PX=AP$ , so we wish to find $AP$ . Applying the Law of Cosines in $\triangle ACD$ , we have that \[(13\sqrt{3})^2+24^2-2(13\sqrt{3})(24)\cos (\angle ADC)=(7\sqrt{3})^2\implies \cos (\angle ADC)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\implies \angle ADC=30^{\circ}.\] Then because $\angle CDP=60^{\circ}$ , then $\angle ADP=90^{\circ}$ , so we can find $AP$ simply with the Pythagorean Theorem. We know $AD=13\sqrt{3}$ and $DP=CD=24$ , so $AP=\sqrt{(13\sqrt{3})^2+24^2}=19\sqrt{3}$ .
We then have $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX+EX=(BX+EX)+(AX+CX+DX)=BE+AP=38+19\sqrt{3}$ , which is our minimum value. Therefore, the answer to the problem is $38+19+3=\boxed{060}$ .

## Solution 3(Fermat Point)
$AE = 26$ , $DE = 13$ , and $\angle{E}={60}^{\circ}$ , which means that $\triangle{AED}$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $AD = 13\sqrt3$ , $\angle{EAD}={30}^{\circ}$ , and $\angle{ADE}={90}^{\circ}$ . Similar with $\triangle{ABC}$ , $AD = 7\sqrt3$ , $\angle{BAC}={30}^{\circ}$ , and $\angle{ACB}={90}^{\circ}$
To solve the question, we would have to locate point $X$ first. We first consider the points $B$ and $E$ . For the distance of $X$ to $B$ and $E$ to become the shortest, $X$ should lay on $BE$ . For $X$ to be closest to point $A$ , it should be on the foot of perpendicular from $A$ to line $BE$ .
Consider about $C$ and $D$ . $\angle{ADE}=\angle{AXE}={90}^{\circ}$ , so $AXDE$ is cyclic. Therefore, $\angle{EXD}=\angle{EAD}=\angle{BXC}={30}^{\circ}$ . $\angle{DXC}=\angle{AXD}=\angle{AXD}={120}^{\circ}$ , so $X$ is coincidently the Fermat Point of $ADC$ .
To calculate the $f(X)$ , we divide it into 2 parts: the sum of distance to $A$ , $C$ , and $D$ and the sum of distance to $B$ and $E$ . Applying Ptolemy's Theorem in $AXDE$ and $AXCB$ , \[AX+2DX=\sqrt3EX\] \[and\] \[AX+2CX=\sqrt3BX\] We get that $AX+DX+CX = \frac{\sqrt3}{2}\cdot(EX+BX) = \frac{\sqrt3}{2}BE$
Construct equilateral triangle $\triangle{ADE}$ outside of $\triangle{ADC}$ on side $AD$ . Because $X$ is the Fermat Point, $FC=AX+DX+CX$ . To calculate $FC$ , we needed to utilize $\angle{FDC}$
\[\angle{FDC}=\angle{FDA}+\angle{ADC}={60}^{\circ}+\angle{ADC}\] .
From $\triangle{ADC}$ , we know: \begin{align*} \cos{\angle{ADC}} & = \frac{(13\sqrt3)^2+{24}^2-(7\sqrt3)^2}{2\cdot13\sqrt3\cdot24}\\ &= \frac{936}{2\cdot13\sqrt3\cdot24}\\ &= \frac{\sqrt3}{2}\\ \end{align*}
This shows that $\angle{ADC} = {30}^{\circ}$ , which means that $\angle{FDC} = {60}^{\circ}+{30}^{\circ}={90}^{\circ}$
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, \[FC = \sqrt{(13\sqrt3)^2+24^2)}=19\sqrt3=AX+DX+CD\] \[f(X) = 19\sqrt3(1+\frac{2}{\sqrt3})=38+19\sqrt3\]
The answer is $38+19+3=\boxed{060}$
