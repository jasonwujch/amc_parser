# 2017 AMC 10B Problem 1

## Problem

Mary thought of a positive two-digit number. She multiplied it by $3$ and added $11$ . Then she switched the digits of the result, obtaining a number between $71$ and $75$ , inclusive. What was Mary's number?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 11\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 13\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 14\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution 1
Let her $2$ -digit number be $x$ . Multiplying by $3$ makes it a multiple of $3$ , meaning that the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$ . Adding on $11$ increases the sum of the digits by $1+1 = 2,$ (we can ignore numbers such as $39+11=50$ ) and reversing the digits keeps the sum of the digits the same; this means that the resulting number must be $2$ more than a multiple of $3$ . There are two such numbers between $71$ and $75$ : $71$ and $74.$ Now that we have narrowed down the choices, we can simply test the answers to see which one will provide a two-digit number when the steps are reversed: \[\] For $71,$ we reverse the digits, resulting in $17.$ Subtracting $11$ , we get $6.$ We can already see that dividing this by $3$ will not be a two-digit number, so $71$ does not meet our requirements. \[\] Therefore, the answer must be the reversed steps applied to $74.$ We have the following: \[\] $74\rightarrow47\rightarrow36\rightarrow12$ \[\] Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\bold{(B)} 12}$ .

## Solution 2
Working backwards, we reverse the digits of each number from $71$ ~ $75$ and subtract $11$ from each, so we have \[6, 16, 26, 36, 46\] The only numbers from this list that are divisible by $3$ are $6$ and $36$ . We divide both by $3$ , yielding $2$ and $12$ . Since $2$ is not a two-digit number, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 12}$ .

## Solution 3
You can just plug in the numbers to see which one works. When you get to $12$ , you multiply by $3$ and add $11$ to get $47$ . When you reverse the digits of $47$ , you get $74$ , which is within the given range. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 12}$ .

## Solution 4 (Fastest Way)
Let x be the original number. The last digit of $3x+11$ must be $7$ so the last digit of $3x$ must be $6$ . The only answer choice that satisfies this is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 12}$ .

## Solution 5
Subtract $11$ from the numbers $71$ through $75$ . This yields $71-11 = 60$ , $72-11 = 61$ , $73-11 = 62$ , $74-11 = 63$ , and $75-11 = 64$ . Of these, the only ones divisible by $3$ are $60$ and $63$ . Therefore, the only possible values are $71$ and $74$ . Switching the digits of each, we get $17$ and $47$ . Subtracting $11$ from each, we get the numbers $6$ and $36$ . Dividing each by $3$ , we get $2$ and $12$ . The only two-digit number is $12$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 12}$ .
