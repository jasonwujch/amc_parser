## Problem

The lines with equations $ax-2y=c$ and $2x+by=-c$ are perpendicular and intersect at $(1, -5)$ . What is $c$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ -13\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ -8\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 13$

## Solution
Writing each equation in slope-intercept form, we get $y=\frac{a}{2}x-\frac{1}{2}c$ and $y=-\frac{2}{b}x-\frac{c}{b}$ . We observe the slope of each equation is $\frac{a}{2}$ and $-\frac{2}{b}$ , respectively. Because the slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope $m$ is $-\frac{1}{m}$ , we see that $\frac{a}{2}=-\frac{1}{-\frac{2}{b}}$ because it is given that the two lines are perpendicular. This equation simplifies to $a=b$ .
Because $(1, -5)$ is a solution of both equations, we deduce $a \times 1-2 \times -5=c$ and $2 \times 1+b \times -5=-c$ . Because we know that $a=b$ , the equations reduce to $a+10=c$ and $2-5a=-c$ . Solving this system of equations, we get $c=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 13}$

## Solution 2 (Not recommended)
It is possible to derive the formula that $c=-\frac{b(m^2+n^2)}{m+n}$ for $ax-by = c$ is perpendicular to $bx+dy=-c$ at point $(m,n)$ . Plug in $b=2$ , $m=1$ , and $n=-5$ to get $c=-\frac{2 \times 26}{-4} = 13$ , which is answer choice $(\text{E}) 13$ .
