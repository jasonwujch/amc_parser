## Problem

Elmer's new car gives $50\%$ percent better fuel efficiency, measured in kilometers per liter, than his old car. However, his new car uses diesel fuel, which is $20\%$ more expensive per liter than the gasoline his old car used. By what percent will Elmer save money if he uses his new car instead of his old car for a long trip?

$\textbf{(A) } 20\% \qquad \textbf{(B) } 26\tfrac23\% \qquad \textbf{(C) } 27\tfrac79\% \qquad \textbf{(D) } 33\tfrac13\% \qquad \textbf{(E) } 66\tfrac23\%$

## Solution 1
Suppose that his old car runs at $x$ km per liter. Then his new car runs at $\frac{3}{2}x$ km per liter, or $x$ km per $\frac{2}{3}$ of a liter. Let the cost of the old car's fuel be $c$ , so the trip in the old car takes $xc$ dollars, while the trip in the new car takes $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{6}{5}xc = \frac{4}{5}xc$ . He saves $\frac{\frac{1}{5}xc}{xc} = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 20\%}$ .

## Solution 2
Because they do not give you a given amount of distance, we'll just make that distance $3x$ miles. Then, we find that the new car will use $2*1.2=2.4x$ . The old car will use $3x$ . Thus the answer is $(3-2.4)/3=.6/3=20/100= \boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 20\%}$ .

## Solution 3
You can find that the ratio of fuel used by the old car and the new car for the same amount of distance is $3 : 2$ , and the ratio between the fuel price of these two cars is $5 : 6$ . Therefore, by multiplying these two ratios, we get that the costs of using these two cars is \[15 : 12 = 5 : 4\] So the percentage of money saved is $1 - \frac{4}{5} = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 20\%}$ .

## Solution 4
Assume WLOG that Elmer's old car's range is $100$ miles. So, Elmer's new car's range is $100 \times 1.5 = 150$ miles. Also, assume that the gas Elmer's old car uses is $\$10$ , which means that diesel will cost $\$12$ . Now we can deduce that Elmer's old car uses $10 \div 100 = \$0.10$ per mile, and Elmer's new car uses $12 \div 150 = \$0.08$ per mile. Therefore, Elmer's new car saves $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }20\%}$ more money than his old car.
