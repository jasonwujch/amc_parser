## Problem

What is the largest number of solid $2\text{-in} \times 2\text{-in} \times 1\text{-in}$ blocks that can fit in a $3\text{-in} \times 2\text{-in}\times3\text{-in}$ box?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 7$

## Solution
We find that the volume of the larger block is $18$ , and the volume of the smaller block is $4$ . Dividing the two, we see that only a maximum of four $2$ by $2$ by $1$ blocks can fit inside the $3$ by $3$ by $2$ block. Drawing it out, we see that such a configuration is indeed possible. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }4}$ .
