# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 4

## Problem

The number $2024$ is written as the sum of not necessarily distinct two-digit numbers. What is the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write this sum?

$\textbf{(A) }20\qquad\textbf{(B) }21\qquad\textbf{(C) }22\qquad\textbf{(D) }23\qquad\textbf{(E) }24$

## Solution 1
Since we want the least number of two-digit numbers, we maximize the two-digit numbers by choosing as many $99$ s as possible. Since $2024=99\cdot20+44\cdot1,$ we choose twenty $99$ s and one $44,$ for a total of $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }21}$ two-digit numbers.

## Solution 2
We claim the answer is $21$ . This can be achieved by adding twenty $99$ 's and a $44$ . To prove that the answer cannot be less than or equal to $20$ , we note that the maximum value of the sum of $20$ or less two digit numbers is $20 \cdot 99 = 1980$ , which is smaller than $2024$ , so we are done. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }21}$ .

## Solution 3 (Same as Solution 1 but Using 100=99+1)
$2024=100\cdot20+24$ . Since $100=99+1$ , $2024=(99+1)\cdot20+24=99\cdot20+1\cdot20+24=99\cdot20+44$ . Therefore a total of $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }21}$ two-digit numbers are needed.

## Solution 4
The maximum $2$ -digit number is $99$ , but try $100$ . $2024 \div 100$ is a little more than $20$ , and the remainder is less than $100$ , by intuition, so there's $20 +$ the remainder $1 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }21}$ .
