# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 18

## Problem

There are exactly $K$ positive integers $b$ with $5 \leq b \leq 2024$ such that the base- $b$ integer $2024_b$ is divisible by $16$ (where $16$ is in base ten). What is the sum of the digits of $K$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }16\qquad\textbf{(B) }17\qquad\textbf{(C) }18\qquad\textbf{(D) }20\qquad\textbf{(E) }21$

## Solution 1
$2024_b = 2b^3+2b+4\equiv 0\pmod{16}\implies b^3+b+2\equiv 0\pmod 8$ . If $b$ is even, then $b+2\equiv 0\pmod 8\implies b\equiv 6\pmod 8$ . If $b$ is odd, then $b^2\equiv 1\pmod 8\implies b^3+b+2\equiv 2b+2\pmod 8$ so $2b+2\equiv 0\pmod 8\implies b+1\equiv 0\pmod 4\implies b\equiv 3,7\pmod 8$ . Now $8\mid 2024$ so $\frac38\cdot 2024=759$ but one of the answers we got from that, $3$ , is too small, so $759 - 1 = 758\implies\boxed{\textbf{(D) }20}$ .

## Solution 2
\begin{align*} 2024_b\equiv0\pmod{16} \\ 2b^3+2b+4\equiv0\pmod{16} \\ b^3+b+2\equiv0\pmod8 \\ \end{align*}
Clearly, $b$ is either even or odd. If $b$ is even, let $b=2a$ .
\begin{align*} (2a)^3+2a+2\equiv0\pmod8 \\ 8a^3+2a+2\equiv0\pmod8 \\ 0+2a+2\equiv0\pmod8 \\ a+1\equiv0\pmod4 \\ a\equiv3\pmod4 \\ \end{align*}
Thus, one solution is $b=2(4x+3)=8x+6$ for some integer $x$ , or $b\equiv6\pmod8$ .
What if $b$ is odd? Then let $b=2a+1$ :
\begin{align*} (2a+1)^3+2a+1+2\equiv0\pmod8 \\ 8a^3+12a^2+6a+1+2a+1+2\equiv0\pmod8 \\ 8a^3+12a^2+8a+4\equiv0\pmod8 \\ 4a^2+4\equiv0\pmod8 \\ a^2\equiv1\pmod2 \\ \end{align*}
This simply states that $a$ is odd. Thus, the other solution is $b=2(2x+1)+1=4x+3$ for some integer $x$ , or $b\equiv3\pmod4$ .
We now simply must count the number of integers between $5$ and $2024$ , inclusive, that are $6$ mod $8$ or $3$ mod $4$ . Note that the former case comprises even numbers only while the latter is only odd; thus, there is no overlap and we can safely count the number of each and add them.
In the former case, we have the numbers $6,14,22,30,\dots,2022$ ; this list is equivalent to $8,16,24,32,\dots,2024\cong1,2,3,4,\dots,253$ , which comprises $253$ numbers. In the latter case, we have the numbers $7,11,15,19,\dots,2023\cong4,8,12,16,\dots,2020\cong1,2,3,4,\dots,505$ , which comprises $505$ numbers. There are $758$ numbers in total, so our answer is $7+5+8=\boxed{\textbf{(D) 20}}$ .

## Solution 3
Note that $2024_b=2b^3+2b+4$ is to be divisible by $16$ , which means that $b^3+b+2$ is divisible by $8$ .
If $b=0$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (0)^3 + (0) + 2 \equiv 2$ is not divisible by $8$ .
If $b=1$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (1)^3 + (1) + 2 \equiv 4$ is not divisible by $8$ .
If $b=2$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (2)^3 + (2) + 2 \equiv 4$ is not divisible by $8$ .
If $b=3$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (3)^3 + (3) + 2 \equiv (8+1)\cdot3 + (3) + 2 \equiv 0$ is divisible by $8$ .
If $b=4$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (4)^3 + (4) + 2 \equiv 0 + 4 + 2 \equiv 6$ is not divisible by $8$ .
If $b=5$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (-3)^3 + (-3) + 2 \equiv (8+1)\cdot 3 + (-3) + 2 \equiv 2$ is not divisible by $8$ .
If $b=6$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (-2)^3 + (-2) + 2 \equiv -8 + (-2) + 2 \equiv 0$ is divisible by $8$ .
If $b=7$ , then $b^3+b+2 \equiv (-1)^3 + (-1) + 2 \equiv -1 + (-1) + 2 \equiv 0$ is divisible by $8$ .
Therefore, for every $8$ values of $b$ , $3$ of them will make $b^3+b+2$ divisible by $8$ . Therefore, since $2024$ is divisible by $8$ , $\dfrac{3}{8}\cdot2024=759$ values of $b$ , but this includes $b=3$ , which does not satisfy the given inequality. Therefore, the answer is \[759-1=758\rightarrow7+5+8=\boxed{\text{(D) }20}\] ~Tacos_are_yummy_1

## Solution 4
$2024_b=2\ast\ b^3+2\ast\ b+4\ \\ {2024}_{\left(b+8\right)}=2\ast\left(b+8\right)^3+2\ast\left(b+8\right)+4$ ${2024}_{\left(b+8\right)}-{2024}_b=2*\left(8\right)*\left(b^2+8b+64\right)+2*8\ =16*\left(b^2+8b+64\right)+16$
\begin{align*} 2024_{(b+8)}-2024_b\equiv0\ (mod\ 16)\\ 2024_{(b+8)}\ \ \equiv2024_b\ \ (mod\ 16)\\ 2024_0\equiv4\ (mod\ 16)\\ 2024_1\equiv8\ (mod\ 16)\\ 2024_2\equiv6\ (mod\ 16)\\ 2024_3\equiv0(mod\ 16)\\ 2024_4\equiv12(mod\ 16)\\ 2024_5\equiv8(mod\ 16)\\ 2024_6\equiv0(mod\ 16)\\ 2024_7\equiv0(mod\ 16)\\ \end{align*}
We need $b\ \equiv3\ (mod\ 8)\ \ or\ b\ \equiv6\ (mod\ 8)\ \ or\ b\ \equiv7\ (mod\ 8) \\ \lfloor(2024-3)/8\rfloor+\lfloor(2024-6)/8\rfloor+\lfloor(2024-7)/8\rfloor+3=759$ take away one because $b=3$ is out of range, so $758\Rightarrow7+8+5=\boxed{\text{(D) }20}$

## Solution 4.1: Alternate Ending
One can arrange 2024 into different "blocks" consisting of 8 numbers each, particularly \( \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\} \), \( \{8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15\} \) ...
These just represent different \( \mod(8) \) class residues. So, you can just divide 2024 by 8 blocks giving us 253 total blocks with 0 extra semi-blocks.
We see that \( 2024_3 \mod 8 \), \( 2024_6 \mod 8 \), and \( 2024_7 \mod 8 \) all appear exactly 253 times each, so we have \( 253 \times 3 = 759 \) different values of \( K \).
However, we must not include \( 2024_3 \), as the bases \( b \) range from \( 5 \le b \le 2024 \), therefore we have \( 759-1=758 \) cases.
Our answer is \( 7+5+8= \) $\boxed{\text{(D) }20}$ .

## Solution 5 (Factoring)
Start similar to other solutions.
\[b^3+b+2 \equiv 0\pmod 8\]
Except now we notice the following:
\begin{align*} b^3+8+b+2 \equiv 8\pmod 8 \equiv 0\pmod 8\\ (b+2)(b^2-2b+4) + b+2 \equiv 0\pmod 8\\ (b+2)(b^2-2b+5) \equiv 0\pmod 8\\ \end{align*}
Notice that $b+2$ and $b^2-2b+5$ have opposite parity, and when multiplied, is divisible by $8$ . Thus, either $b+2$ or $b^2-2b+5$ is divisible by $8$ .
$b+2$ is obvious, where $b+2 | 8$ when $b \equiv 6\pmod 8$
When testing for $b^2-2b+5 | 8$ , we find $b \equiv 3, 7\pmod 8$
Proceed similar to the other solutions, $\lfloor\dfrac{3}{8} \cdot 2024\rfloor-1=759-1=758$ , where $7+5+8=\boxed{\text{(D) }20}$
Also noting this is an example of a misplaced problem this would be far to easy for even P 18 of amc 10, deserved to be Q5-6
