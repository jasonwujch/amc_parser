# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 9

## Problem

In how many ways can $6$ juniors and $6$ seniors form $3$ disjoint teams of $4$ people so that each team has $2$ juniors and $2$ seniors?

$\textbf{(A) }720\qquad\textbf{(B) }1350\qquad\textbf{(C) }2700\qquad\textbf{(D) }3280\qquad\textbf{(E) }8100$

## Solution 1
The number of ways in which we can choose the juniors for the team are ${6\choose2}{4\choose2}{2\choose2}=15\cdot6\cdot1=90$ . Similarly, the number of ways to choose the seniors are the same, so the total is $90\cdot90=8100$ . But we must divide the number of permutations of three teams, since the order in which the teams were chosen doesn't matter, which is $3!$ . Thus, the answer is $\frac{8100}{3!}=\frac{8100}{6}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }1350}$

## Solution 2
Let's first suppose that the three teams are distinguishable. The number of ways to choose the first team of two juniors and two seniors is ${6\choose2}{6\choose2} = 15\cdot 15 = 225$ . Now, only four juniors and four seniors are left to choose the second team. Thus, the second team can be formed in ${4\choose2}{4\choose2} = 6\cdot 6 = 36$ ways. There are now only two juniors and two seniors left, so the third team can only be formed in one way. Thus, the total number of ways in which we can choose two juniors and two seniors for three distinguishable teams is $225\cdot 36 = 8100$ ways. However, the problem does not require the teams to be distinguishable. Therefore, we must divide by $3!=6$ to find the answer for three indistinguishable teams.
The answer is $\frac{8100}{6} =\boxed{\textbf{(B) }1350}$
