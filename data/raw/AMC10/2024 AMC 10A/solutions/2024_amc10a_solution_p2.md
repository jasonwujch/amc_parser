# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 2

## Problem

A model used to estimate the time it will take to hike to the top of the mountain on a trail is of the form $T=aL+bG,$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants, $T$ is the time in minutes, $L$ is the length of the trail in miles, and $G$ is the altitude gain in feet. The model estimates that it will take $69$ minutes to hike to the top if a trail is $1.5$ miles long and ascends $800$ feet, as well as if a trail is $1.2$ miles long and ascends $1100$ feet. How many minutes does the model estimates it will take to hike to the top if the trail is $4.2$ miles long and ascends $4000$ feet?

$\textbf{(A) }240\qquad\textbf{(B) }246\qquad\textbf{(C) }252\qquad\textbf{(D) }258\qquad\textbf{(E) }264$

## Solution 1
Plug in the values into the equation to give you the following two equations: \begin{align*} 69&=1.5a+800b, \\ 69&=1.2a+1100b. \end{align*} Solving for the values $a$ and $b$ gives you that $a=30$ and $b=\frac{3}{100}$ . These values can be plugged back in showing that these values are correct. Now, using the given length of the trail, $4.2$ , and the given vertical increase, $4000$ , we get a final answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }246}.$

## Solution 2
Alternatively, observe that using $a=10x$ and $b=\frac{y}{100}$ makes the numbers much closer to each other in terms of magnitude.
Plugging in the new variables: \begin{align*} 69&=15x+8y, \\ 69&=12x+11y. \end{align*}
The solution becomes more obvious in this way, with $15+8=12+11=23$ , and since $23\cdot 3=69$ , we determine that $x=y=3$ .
The question asks us for $4.2a+4000b=42x+40y$ . Since $x=y$ , we have $(40+42)\cdot 3=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }246}$ .
