## Problem

The product of three integers is $60$ . What is the least possible positive sum of the three integers?

$\textbf{(A) }2\qquad\textbf{(B) }3\qquad\textbf{(C) }5\qquad\textbf{(D) }6\qquad\textbf{(E) }13$

## Solution 1
We notice that the optimal solution involves two negative numbers and a positive number. Thus we may split $60$ into three factors and choose negativity. We notice that $10\cdot6\cdot1=10\cdot(-6)\cdot(-1)=60$ , and trying other combinations does not yield lesser results so the answer is $10-6-1=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }3}$ .

## Solution 2
We have $abc = 60$ . Let $a$ be positive, and let $b$ and $c$ be negative. Then we need $a > |b + c|$ . If $a = 6$ , then $|b + c|$ is at least $7$ , so this doesn't work. If $a = 10$ , then $(b,c) = (-6,-1)$ works, giving $10 - 7 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }3}$

## Solution 3
We can see that the most optimal solution would be $1$ positive integer and $2$ negative ones (as seen in solution 1). Let the three integers be $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ , and let $x$ be positive and $y$ and $z$ be negative. If we want the optimal solution, we want the negative numbers to be as large as possible. so the answer should be $-60 \cdot -1 \cdot 1$ , where $-60 - 1 + 1 = -60$ ... right?
No! Our sum must be positive, so that would be invalid! We see that - $30, -20, -15$ , and $-10$ are too less to allow the sum to be positive. For example, $-15 = z. -15xy=60$ , so $xy = -4$ . For $xy$ to be the most positive, we will have $4$ and $-1$ . Yet, $-15+4-1$ is still negative. After $-10$ , the next factor of $60$ would be $-6$ . if $z$ = $-6$ , $xy = -10$ . This might be positive! Now, if we have $z = -6, y = -1$ , and $x = 10, x + y + z = 3$ . It cannot be smaller because $x = 5$ and $y = -2$ would result in $x + y + z$ being negative. Therefore, our answer would be $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }3}$ .
