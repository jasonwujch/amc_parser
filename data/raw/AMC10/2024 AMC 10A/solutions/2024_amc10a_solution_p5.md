# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 5

## Problem

What is the least value of $n$ such that $n!$ is a multiple of $2024$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 11\qquad\textbf{(B) } 21\qquad\textbf{(C) } 22\qquad\textbf{(D) } 23\qquad\textbf{(E) } 253$

## Solution
Note that $2024=2^3\cdot11\cdot23$ in the prime factorization. Since $23!$ is a multiple of $2^3, 11,$ and $23,$ we conclude that $23!$ is a multiple of $2024.$ Therefore, we have $n=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 23}.$
Remark
Memorizing the prime factorization of the current year is useful for the AMC 8/10/12 Exams.

Remark
Note that $2024$ is $2025 -1$ , which is $45^2 -1 = (45+1)(45-1) = 46\cdot44$ .
