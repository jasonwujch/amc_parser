# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 12

## Problem

Zelda played the Adventures of Math game on August 1 and scored $1700$ points. She continued to play daily over the next $5$ days. The bar chart below shows the daily change in her score compared to the day before. (For example, Zelda's score on August 2 was $1700 + 80 = 1780$ points.) What was Zelda's average score in points over the $6$ days?

$\textbf{(A)} 1700\qquad\textbf{(B)} 1702\qquad\textbf{(C)} 1703\qquad\textbf{(D)}1713\qquad\textbf{(E)} 1715$

## Solution 1
Going through the table, we see her scores over the six days were: $1700$ , $1700+80=1780$ , $1780-90=1690$ , $1690-10=1680$ , $1680+60=1740$ , and $1740-40=1700$ .
Taking the average, we get $\frac{(1700+1780+1690+1680+1740+1700)}{6} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 1715}.$

## Solution 2
Compared to the first day $(1700)$ , her scores change by $+80$ , $-10$ , $-20$ , $+40$ , and $+0$ . So, the average is $1700 + \frac{80-10-20+40+0}{6} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }1715}$ .
Sidenote: Many people would just add up the changes, which would give them 1700. That is wrong.

## Solution 3
As the scores of each day are dependent on previous days, we get: $1700 + \dfrac{0\cdot6 + 80\cdot5 + (-90)\cdot4 + (-10)\cdot3 + 60\cdot2 + (-40)\cdot1}{6} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }1715}$

## Solution 4
Plugging in x as 1700, we get the variables as: x + 80, x-10, x-20, x+40, and x. Finding the average of this gets us (6x + 90)/6 = x + 15 Since x is 1700 we get our answer as 1700 + 15 = $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }1715}$
