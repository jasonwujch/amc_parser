# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 19

## Problem

The first three terms of a geometric sequence are the integers $a,\,720,$ and $b,$ where $a<720<b.$ What is the sum of the digits of the least possible value of $b?$

$\textbf{(A) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 12 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 16 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 18 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 21$

## Solution 1
For a geometric sequence, we have $ab=720^2=2^8 3^4 5^2$ , and we can test values for $b$ . We find that $b=768$ and $a=675$ works, and we can test multiples of $5$ in between the two values. Finding that none of the multiples of 5 divide $720^2$ besides $720$ itself, we know that the answer is $7+6+8=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 21}$ .
(Note: To find the value of $b$ without bashing, we can observe that $2^8=256$ , and that multiplying it by $3$ gives us $768$ , which is really close to $720$ . ~ YTH)
Note: The reason why $ab=720^2$ is because $b/720 = 720/a$ . Rearranging this gives $ab = 720^2$

Note: Another reason that $ab=720^2$ is because the $\sqrt{ab}=720$ (as the middle term in a geometric series is always the geometric mean [the geometric mean is the square root of the product of the first and last terms of the series]) and squaring on both sides results in $ab=720^2$ .

Note: Because it is a geometric sequence, it is clear that $a*k = 720$ and $720*k = b$ . Then, $a*k = 720 = b/k$ . Multiply the first and third term together and it is equal to the middle term multiplied by itself.

## Solution 2
We have $720 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$ . We want to find factors $x$ and $y$ where $y>x$ such that $\frac{y}{x}$ is minimized, as $720 \cdot \frac{y}{x}$ will then be the least possible value of $b$ . After experimenting, we see this is achieved when $y=16$ and $x=15$ , which means our value of $b$ is $720 \cdot \frac{16}{15} = 768$ , so therefore our sum is $7+6+8=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 21}$ .

## Solution 3 (Similar to previous solutions)
To minimize the value of $b$ , where it has to be an integer, and it has to be greater than 720, we can express the common ratio as $\dfrac{n+1}{n}$ , where the value has to be greater than $1$ , and $n$ , and $n+1$ have to be factors of 720. Since the bigger the denominator gets, the smaller the value of the fraction, we essentially have to find the biggest value for $n$ , where itself and $n+1$ are factors of $720$ . From here, we can check whether $n(n+1) = 720$ yields an integer root, which it doesn't. So, then we check the next biggest factor of $720$ , which is $360$ . $n(n+1) = 360$ , this doesn't have an integer root either. So, then we check the next biggest factor which is $240$ , $n(n+1) = 240$ , which we get $15$ as a root. This means the common ration is $\dfrac{16}{15}$ . We then multiply $\dfrac{16}{15}$ times $720$ and add up the digits getting $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 21}$ .

## Solution 4
Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $\frac{x}{y}$ , with $x>y$ . This means that $720(\frac{x}{y})$ and $720(\frac{y}{x})$ must both be integers, therefore $x$ and $y$ are both factors of $720$ . We would achieve the smallest ratio $\frac{x}{y}$ if $x$ and $y$ are consecutive, so by listing out the factors of $720$ , we find that $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , $4$ , $5$ , $6$ , $8$ , $9$ , $10$ , $15$ , $16$ are the only consecutive factors (any factors larger than these would result in the ratio simplifying, making it larger than just using consecutive integers). $15$ and $16$ are the largest, so we find the common ratio to be $\frac{16}{15}$ , making $b=720(\frac{16}{15})$ giving us $768$ . The sum of its digits is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 21}$ .

## Solution 5 (similar to other solutions)
We look for the smallest possible increasing ratio in the geometric sequence for $a$ , $720$ , and $b$ . First, we find the prime factorization of $720$ , which is really easy $720=2^4\cdot3^2\cdot5$ . Then, we look for the closest possible fraction-ratio out of the primes, and after a quick look, it's easy to see it is $16$ and $15$ . Now that we found our ratio, we multiply $720$ by $16/15$ to get $768$ , so the sum of the digits of the least possible value of $b$ is $21$ .
