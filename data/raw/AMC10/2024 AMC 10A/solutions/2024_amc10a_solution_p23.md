# 2024 AMC 10A Problem 23

## Problem

Integers $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ satisfy $ab + c = 100$ , $bc + a = 87$ , and $ca + b = 60$ . What is $ab + bc + ca$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }212 \qquad \textbf{(B) }247 \qquad \textbf{(C) }258 \qquad \textbf{(D) }276 \qquad \textbf{(E) }284 \qquad$

## Solution 1
Subtracting the first two equations yields $(a-c)(b-1)=13$ . Notice that both factors are integers, so $b-1$ could equal one of $13,1,-1,-13$ and $b=14,2,0,-12$ . We consider each case separately:
For $b=0$ , from the second equation, we see that $a=87$ . Then $87c=60$ , which is not possible as $c$ is an integer, so this case is invalid.
For $b=2$ , we have $2c+a=87$ and $ca=58$ , which by experimentation on the factors of $58$ has no solution, so this is also invalid.
For $b=14$ , we have $14c+a=87$ and $ca=46$ , which by experimentation on the factors of $46$ has no solution, so this is also invalid.
Thus, we must have $b=-12$ , so $a=12c+87$ and $ca=72$ . Thus $c(12c+87)=72$ , so $c(4c+29)=24$ . We can simply trial and error this to find that $c=-8$ so then $a=-9$ . The answer is then $(-9)(-12)+(-12)(-8)+(-8)(-9)=108+96+72=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }276}$ .

## Solution 2
Adding up first two equations: \[(a+c)(b+1)=187\] \[b+1=\pm 11,\pm 17\] \[b=-12,10,-18,16\]
Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: \[(a-c)(b-1)=13\] \[b-1=\pm 1,\pm 13\] \[b=0,2,-12,14\]
\[\Rightarrow b=-12\]
Which implies that $a+c=-17$ from $(a+c)(b+1)=187$
Giving us that $a+b+c=-29$
Therefore, $ab+bc+ac=100+87+60-(a+b+c)=\boxed{\text{(D) }276}$

## Solution 3 (Guess and check)
The idea is that you could guess values for $c$ , since then $a$ and $b$ are factors of $100 - c$ . The important thing to realize is that $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are all negative. Then, this can be solved in a few minutes, giving the solution $(-9, -12, -8)$ , which gives the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} 276}$ ~andliu766

## Solution 4
\begin{align} ab + c &= 100 \\ bc + a &= 87 \\ ca + b &= 60 \end{align}
\[(1) + (2) \implies ab + c +bc + a = (a+c)(b+1)=187\implies b+1=\pm 11,\pm 17\]
\[(1) - (2) \implies ab + c - bc - a = (a-c)(b-1)=13\implies b-1=\pm 1,\pm 13\]
Note that $(b+1)-(b-1)=2$ , and the only possible pair of results that yields this is $b-1=-13$ and $b+1=-11$ , so $a+c=-17$ .
Therefore,
\[ab+ba+ac=ab + c +bc + a + ca + b -(a+b+c) = (1)+(2)+(3) - (a+b+c) = 100+87+60-(a+b+c)=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }276}.\] ~ luckuso , yuvag, Technodoggo (LaTeX credits to the latter two and editing to the latter)

## Solution 5
\begin{align} ab + c &= 100 \\ bc + a &= 87 \\ ca + b &= 60 \end{align}
\begin{align*} (1) - (2) \implies ab + c -bc - a &=(a-c)(b-1)=13 \\ (2) - (3) \implies bc + a -ca - b &=(b-a)(c-1)=27 \\ (3) - (1) \implies ca + b -ab - c &=(c-b)(a-1)=-40 \end{align*}
There are $3$ ordered pairs of $(a,b,c)$ : $(5,14,4)$ , $(-3,-12,-3)$ , $(-9,-12,-8)$ .
However, only the last ordered pair meets all three equations.
Therefore, $ab+ba+ac= -9\cdot-12+-12\cdot-8+-8\cdot-9 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }276}.$

## Solution 6 (Elimination)
Before we start, keep in mind that the problem is asking for the sum \(ab+bc+ac\). This is nothing but \(100+87+60-a-b-c\), or \(247-(a+b+c\)).
To solve the problem, we systematically test the options using elimination:
Let's first check options A and B, since they only happen when a,b, and c sum to 35 or 0. We begin by testing three positive values, but none satisfy the equation when there is a plus sign. For example, \( (12, 8, 4) \) satisfies \( ab + c = 100 \), but does not satisfy \( bc + a = 87\), or \( ac + b = 60\). If \(a+b+c=0\), then not all of the numbers can be positive or negative, so this would not work. From this observation, we conclude that the answer cannot be \( \textbf{A} \) or \( \textbf{B} \).
Now let's test the next option, option C. Option \( \textbf{C} \) states \( ab + bc + ca = 258 \). If true, then:
\(a + b + c = -11\)
This sum is too large. Furthermore, if all three numbers are negative, the solution still fails. For example, testing \( (-4, -5, -2) \) confirms the equation is not satisfied, as we get results that are too small. Thus, we eliminate option \( \textbf{C} \).
Finally, let's test the last two options: D and E. For option \( \textbf{E} \), the sum \( a + b + c \) would be:
\(247 - 284 = -37\)
Testing values such as \( (-11, -12, -14) \), the resulting sums \( ab + c \), \( bc + a \), and \( ac + b \) are far too large to satisfy the equation. Therefore, \( \textbf{E} \) is also eliminated.
Once we have this answer, we still need to verify it by testing out numbers: Finally, we test option \( \textbf{D} \). Using \( ab + bc + ca = 276 \), we get that \(a+b+c = -29\). Also note that a, b, and c all have to be different, because the sums from the three equations are all different. We want to get the three closest values of a, b, and c such that they are all different, and the sum \(a+b+c = -29\). The values \( (-9, -12, -8) \) are the closest three numbers. When we try them, they satisfy all three equations. So, the correct answer is: $ab+ba+ac= -9\cdot-12+-12\cdot-8+-8\cdot-9 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }276}.$
