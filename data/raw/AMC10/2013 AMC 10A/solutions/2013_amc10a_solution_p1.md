## Problem

A taxi ride costs $\$1.50$ plus $\$0.25$ per mile traveled. How much does a $5$ -mile taxi ride cost?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2.25 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2.50 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 2.75 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 3.00 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 3.75$

## Solution
There are five miles which need to be traveled. The cost of these five miles is $(0.25\cdot5) = 1.25$ . Adding this to $1.50$ , we get $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }2.75}$
