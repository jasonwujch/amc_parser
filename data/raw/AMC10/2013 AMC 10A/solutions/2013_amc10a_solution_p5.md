# 2013 AMC 10A Problem 5

## Problem

Tom, Dorothy, and Sammy went on a vacation and agreed to split the costs evenly. During their trip Tom paid \$105, Dorothy paid \$125, and Sammy paid \$175. In order to share costs equally, Tom gave Sammy $t$ dollars, and Dorothy gave Sammy $d$ dollars. What is $t-d$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 25\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 35$

## Solution 1
The total amount paid is $105 + 125 + 175 = 405$ . To get how much each should have paid, we do $405/3 = 135$ .
Thus, we know that Tom needs to give Sammy 30 dollars, and Dorothy 10 dollars. This means that $t-d = 30 - 10 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }20}$ .

## Solution 2
The difference in the money that Tom paid and Dorothy paid is $20$ . In order for them both to have paid the same amount, Tom must pay $20$ more than Dorothy. The answer is $\boxed{{(B)20}}$ .

## Solution 3
The meaning of sharing costs equally is meaning that, after the vacation, they are equally dividing the money in a way such that, each person would have the same amount left. As each person spends an amount of money, greater than 100, let it be that they all had $200$ dollars to spend. This means that after the vacation we want the amount of money, they currently have. After the trip, Tom would've $95$ dollars, Dorothy would've $75$ dollars, and Sammy had $25$ dollars. This gives us a total of $95+75+25=195$ dollars.
We want to equally split this money, as that is what happens after splitting the cost equally. This means that we want Dorothy, Tom, and Sammy to each have $65$ dollars. We know that Tom gave Sammy $t$ dollars meaning that we want to split this money first. As Tom gives money to no one else, we want him to reach $65$ dollars in this trade, meaning that as Tom has $95$ dollars and Sammy has $25$ dollars, we can do a trade of $30$ so $t=30$ . After this trade, we get that Tom has $65$ dollars, Sammy has $55$ dollars, and Dorothy has $75$ dollars.
Next trade is where Dorothy gives $d$ dollars to Sammy. Dorothy has $75$ dollars and Sammy has $55$ dollars. As both of these don't have $65$ dollars and this is the last trade, we need to make sure both have $65$ dollars at the end. This is possible if $d=10$
We want to find $t-d=30-10=\boxed{B) 20}$
