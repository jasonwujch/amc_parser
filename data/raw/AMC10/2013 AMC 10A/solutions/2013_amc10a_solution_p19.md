# 2013 AMC 10A Problem 19

## Problem

In base $10$ , the number $2013$ ends in the digit $3$ . In base $9$ , on the other hand, the same number is written as $(2676)_{9}$ and ends in the digit $6$ . For how many positive integers $b$ does the base- $b$ -representation of $2013$ end in the digit $3$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 9\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 13\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 16\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 18$

## Solution 1
We want the integers $b$ such that $2013\equiv 3\pmod{b} \Rightarrow b$ is a factor of $2010$ . Since $2010=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 67$ , it has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=2^4=16$ factors. Since $b$ cannot equal $1, 2,$ or $3$ , as these can not have the digit $3$ in their base representations, our answer is $16-3=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$
