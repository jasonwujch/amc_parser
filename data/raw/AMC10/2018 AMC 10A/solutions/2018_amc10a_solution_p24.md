## Solution 1
Let $BC = a$ , $BG = x$ , $GC = y$ , and the length of the perpendicular from $BC$ through $A$ be $h$ . By angle bisector theorem, we have that \[\frac{50}{x} = \frac{10}{y},\] where $y = -x+a$ . Therefore substituting we have that $BG=\frac{5a}{6}$ . By similar triangles, we have that $DF=\frac{5a}{12}$ , and the height of this trapezoid is $\frac{h}{2}$ . Then, we have that $\frac{ah}{2}=120$ . We wish to compute $\frac{5a}{8}\cdot\frac{h}{2}$ , and we have that it is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }75}$ by substituting.

## Solution 2
For this problem, we have $\triangle{ADE}\sim\triangle{ABC}$ because of SAS and $DE = \frac{BC}{2}$ . Therefore, $\bigtriangleup ADE$ is a quarter of the area of $\bigtriangleup ABC$ , which is $30$ . Subsequently, we can compute the area of quadrilateral $BDEC$ to be $120 - 30 = 90$ . Using the angle bisector theorem in the same fashion as the previous problem, we get that $\overline{BG}$ is $5$ times the length of $\overline{GC}$ . We want the larger piece, as described by the problem. Because the heights are identical, one area is $5$ times the other, and $\frac{5}{6} \cdot 90 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }75}$ .

## Solution 3
The ratio of the $\overline{BG}$ to $\overline{GC}$ is $5:1$ by the Angle Bisector Theorem, so area of $\bigtriangleup ABG$ to the area of $\bigtriangleup ACG$ is also $5:1$ (They have the same height). Therefore, the area of $\bigtriangleup ABG$ is $\frac{5}{5+1}\times120=100$ . Since $\overline{DE}$ is the midsegment of $\bigtriangleup ABC$ , so $\overline{DF}$ is the midsegment of $\bigtriangleup ABG$ . Thus, the ratio of the area of $\bigtriangleup ADF$ to the area of $\bigtriangleup ABG$ is $1:4$ , so the area of $\bigtriangleup ACG$ is $\frac{1}{4}\times100=25$ . Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ is $[ABG]-[ADF]=100-25=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }75}$

## Solution 4
The area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ is the area of $\bigtriangleup ABG$ minus the area of $\bigtriangleup ADF$ . Notice, $\overline{DE} || \overline{BC}$ , so $\bigtriangleup ABG \sim \bigtriangleup ADF$ , and since $\overline{AD}:\overline{AB}=1:2$ , the area of $\bigtriangleup ADF:\bigtriangleup ABG=(1:2)^2=1:4$ . Given that the area of $\bigtriangleup ABC$ is $120$ , using $\frac{bh}{2}$ on side $AB$ yields $\frac{50h}{2}=120\implies h=\frac{240}{50}=\frac{24}{5}$ . Using the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\overline{BG}:\overline{BC}=50:(10+50)=5:6$ , so the height of $\bigtriangleup ABG: \bigtriangleup ACB=5:6$ . Therefore our answer is $\big[ FDBG\big] = \big[ABG\big]-\big[ ADF\big] = \big[ ABG\big]\big(1-\frac{1}{4}\big)=\frac{3}{4}\cdot \frac{bh}{2}=\frac{3}{8}\cdot 50\cdot \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{24}{5}=\frac{3}{8}\cdot 200=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }75}$

## Solution 5 (Trigonometry)
We try to find the area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ by subtracting the area outside the quadrilateral but inside triangle $ABC$ . Note that the area of $\triangle ADE$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 25 \cdot 5 \cdot \sin{A}$ and the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 50 \cdot 10 \cdot \sin A$ . The ratio $\frac{[ADE]}{[ABC]}$ is thus equal to $\frac{1}{4}$ and the area of triangle $ADE$ is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 120 = 30$ . Let side $BC$ be equal to $6x$ , then $BG = 5x, GC = x$ by the angle bisector theorem. Similarly, we find the area of triangle $AGC$ to be $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot x \cdot \sin C$ and the area of triangle $ABC$ to be $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6x \cdot 10 \cdot \sin C$ . A ratio between these two triangles yields $\frac{[ACG]}{[ABC]} = \frac{x}{6x} = \frac{1}{6}$ , so $[AGC] = 20$ . Now we just need to find the area of triangle $AFE$ and subtract it from the combined areas of $[ADE]$ and $[ACG]$ , since we count it twice. Note that the angle bisector theorem also applies for $\triangle ADE$ and $\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{1}{5}$ , so thus $\frac{EF}{ED} = \frac{1}{6}$ and we find $[AFE] = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 30 = 5$ , and the area outside $FDBG$ must be $[ADE] + [AGC] - [AFE] = 30 + 20 - 5 = 45$ , and we finally find $[FDBG] = [ABC] - 45 = 120 -45 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }75}$ , and we are done.

## Solution 7 (Barycentrics)
Let our reference triangle be $\triangle ABC$ . Consequently, we have $A=(1,0,0)$ , $B=(0,1,0)$ , $C=(0,0,1).$ Since $D$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ , we have that $D=(1:1:0)$ . Similarly, we have $E=(1:0:1).$ Hence, the line through $D$ and $E$ is given by the equation
\[0 = \begin{vmatrix} x & y & z\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{vmatrix}\]
Additionally, since all points on $\overline{AG}$ are characterized by $(t:1:5)$ , we may plug in for $x,y,z$ to get $t=6$ . Thus, we have $F=(6:1:5).$ Now, we homogenize the coordinates for $F D, B, G$ to get $F=(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{5}{12}, \frac{1}{12})$ , $D=(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ , $B=(0,1,0)$ , $G=(0, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{5}{6})$
Splitting $[FBGD]$ into $[ DBG ] + [ FDG],$ we may now evaluate the two determinants:
\[\begin{vmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{5}{6} \end{vmatrix}\] \[\begin{vmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{12} & \frac{5}{12}\\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\ 0 & \frac{5}{6} & \frac{1}{6} \end{vmatrix}.\]
After simplification, we get $\frac{5}{12}$ and $\frac{5}{24}$ , respectively. Summing, we get $\frac{15}{24}.$ Hence, $[FBGD]=\frac{15}{24} \cdot 120 = \fbox{\textbf{(D) }75}.$ $\sim$ Math0323

## Solution 8
We want to find ratios. Start off letting [AEF]=1. Then we know [AEF]=[CEF]=1 since AE=CE and they share the same height. Then, also because AE is half of AC, we see that [AEF]=1/4 [ACG] so [ACG]=4.
But we also know [EFGC]=3/4 [ACG], so [EFGC]=3 and then [CFG]=2. If [CFG]=2, then note that [FGB] must be 2*5=10.
Now, we see that [AFD]=5[AED] because EF=1/5 FD (from angle bisector theorem) and they share the same height. Then, because AD=DB, we have [FDB]=[FAD]=5.
Adding these up, we see that the ratio of [BGFD] to [ABC] is 15/24=5/8. 5/8*120 yields our answer of 75. ~mathboy282

## Solution 9
Draw a nice diagram. Lets find some some areas. We will start by finding $[AED]$ . The side length ratio of $\triangle{AED}$ to $\triangle{ACB}$ is $\dfrac{1}{2}$ , so the area ratio is $\dfrac{1}{4}$ , so $[AED] = \dfrac{1}{4} \cdot 120 = 30$ . Lets look for information we have used yet. We still havent used the fact that $AG$ is an angle bisector. This hints at us using the angle bisector theorem. Letting $EF = y$ , we have $FD = 5y$ , and letting $CG = x$ , $GB = 5x$ . Now, we have \[\dfrac{[AEF]}{[AED]} = \dfrac{1}{6} \Longrightarrow [AEF] = \dfrac{1}{6} \cdot 30 = 5, [AFD] = \dfrac{5}{6} \cdot 30 = 25\] . Doing the same thing with triangles $ACG$ and $AGB$ , we find that $[AGB] = 100$ , and so $[FDGB] = 100-25 = \boxed{75}$
