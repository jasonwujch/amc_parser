# 2018 AMC 10A Problem 17

## Problem

Let $S$ be a set of $6$ integers taken from $\{1,2,\dots,12\}$ with the property that if $a$ and $b$ are elements of $S$ with $a<b$ , then $b$ is not a multiple of $a$ . What is the least possible value of an element in $S$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 7$

## Solution 1
We start with $2$ because $1$ is not an answer choice. We would have to include every odd number except $1$ to fill out the set, but then $3$ and $9$ would violate the rule, so that won't work.
Experimentation with $3$ shows it's likewise impossible. You can include $7,11,$ and either $5$ or $10$ (which are always safe). But after adding either $4$ or $8$ we have no more valid numbers.
Finally, starting with $4,$ we find that the sequence $4,5,6,7,9,11$ works, giving us $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 4}.$

## Solution 2
We know that all odd numbers except $1,$ namely $3, 5, 7, 9, 11,$ can be used.
Now we have $7$ possibilities to choose from for the last number (out of $1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12$ ). We can eliminate $1, 2, 10,$ and $12,$ and we have $4, 6, 8$ to choose from. However, $9$ is a multiple of $3.$ Now we have to take out either $3$ or $9$ from the list. If we take out $9,$ none of the numbers would work, but if we take out $3,$ we get \[4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11.\] The least number is $4,$ so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 4}.$

## Solution 3
We can get the multiples for the numbers in the original set with multiples in the same original set \begin{align*} 1&: \ \text{all elements of }\{1,2,\dots,12\} \\ 2&: \ 4,6,8,10,12 \\ 3&: \ 6,9,12 \\ 4&: \ 8,12 \\ 5&: \ 10 \\ 6&: \ 12 \end{align*} It will be safe to start with $5$ or $6$ since they have the smallest number of multiples as listed above, but since the question asks for the least, it will be better to try others.
Trying $4,$ we can get $4,5,6,7,9,11.$ So $4$ works. Trying $3,$ it won't work, so the least is $4.$ This means the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 4}.$

## Solution 4
We partition $\{1,2,\ldots,12\}$ into six nonempty subsets such that for every subset, each element is a multiple of all elements less than or equal to itself: \[\{1,2,4,8\}, \ \{3,6,12\}, \ \{5,10\}, \ \{7\}, \ \{9\}, \ \{11\}.\] Clearly, $S$ must contain exactly one element from each subset:
- For $\{5,10\},$ we can select either $5$ or $10.$
- For $\{3,6,12\},$ we can select either $6$ or $12.$ Recall that since $9\in S,$ we cannot select $3.$
- For $\{1,2,4,8\},$ we can select either $4$ (provided that $12\not\in S$ ) or $8.$ Recall that since either $6\in S$ or $12\in S,$ we can select neither $1$ nor $2.$
If $4\in S,$ then the possibilities of $S$ are $\{4,5,6,7,9,11\}$ or $\{4,6,7,9,10,11\}.$ So, the least possible value of an element in $S$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 4}.$
Remark
There exist multiple such partitions of $\{1,2,\ldots,12\}$ into six nonempty subsets, one of which is \[\{1,2,6,12\}, \ \{3,9\}, \ \{4,8\}, \ \{5,10\}, \ \{7\}, \ \{11\}.\] Regardless of which partition we use, we will conclude that to minimize the least element of $S,$ the only possibilities for $S$ are $\{4,5,6,7,9,11\}$ or $\{4,6,7,9,10,11\}.$

## Solution 5
We start with 2 as 1 is not an answer option. Our set would be $\{2,3,5,7,11\}$ . We realize we cannot add 12 to the set because 12 is a multiple of 3. Our set only has 5 elements, so starting with 2 won't work.
We try 3 next. Our set becomes $\{3,4,5,7,11\}$ . We run into the same issue as before so starting with 3 won't work.
We then try 4. Our set becomes $\{4,5,6,7,9,11\}$ . We see we have 6 elements with none being multiples of each other. Therefore our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 4}.$
