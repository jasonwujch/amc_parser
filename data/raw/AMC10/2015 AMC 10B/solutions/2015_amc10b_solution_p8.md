# 2015 AMC 10B Problem 8

## Problem

The letter F shown below is rotated $90^\circ$ clockwise around the origin, then reflected in the $y$ -axis, and then rotated a half turn around the origin. What is the final image?

## Solution
The first rotation moves the base of the $F$ to the negative $y$ -axis, and the stem to the positive $x$ -axis. The reflection then moves the stem to the negative $x$ -axis, with the base unchanged. Then the half turn moves the stem to the positive $x$ axis and the base to the positive $y$ -axis, choice $\boxed{\mathbf{(E)}}$ .
