# 2015 AMC 10B Problem 11

## Problem

Among the positive integers less than $100$ , each of whose digits is a prime number, one is selected at random. What is the probability that the selected number is prime?

$\textbf{(A)} \dfrac{8}{99}\qquad \textbf{(B)} \dfrac{2}{5}\qquad \textbf{(C)} \dfrac{9}{20}\qquad \textbf{(D)} \dfrac{1}{2}\qquad \textbf{(E)} \dfrac{9}{16}$

## Solution 1
The one digit prime numbers are $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , and $7$ . So there are a total of $4\cdot4=16$ ways to choose a two digit number with both digits as primes and $4$ ways to choose a one digit prime, for a total of $4+16=20$ ways. Out of these $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , $7$ , $23$ , $37$ , $53$ , and $73$ are prime. Thus the probability is $\dfrac{8}{20}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)} \dfrac{2}{5}}$ .

## Solution 2 (Listing)
Since the only primes digits are $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , and $7$ , it doesn't seem too hard to list all of the numbers out.
- 2- Prime;
- 3- Prime;
- 5- Prime;
- 7- Prime;
- 22- Composite;
- 23- Prime;
- 25- Composite;
- 27- Composite;
- 32- Composite;
- 33- Composite;
- 35- Composite;
- 37- Prime;
- 52- Composite;
- 53- Prime;
- 55- Composite;
- 57- Composite;
- 72- Composite;
- 73- Prime;
- 75- Composite;
- 77- Composite.
Counting it out, there are $20$ cases and $8$ of these are prime. So the answer is $\dfrac{8}{20}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)} \dfrac{2}{5}}$ . ~JH. L
