## Problem

For how many integers $x$ is the point $(x, -x)$ inside or on the circle of radius $10$ centered at $(5, 5)$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }11\qquad \textbf{(B) }12\qquad \textbf{(C) }13\qquad \textbf{(D) }14\qquad \textbf{(E) }15$

## Solution
The equation of the circle is $(x-5)^2+(y-5)^2=100$ . Plugging in the given conditions we have $(x-5)^2+(-x-5)^2 \leq 100$ . Expanding gives: $x^2-10x+25+x^2+10x+25\leq 100$ , which simplifies to $x^2\leq 25$ and therefore $x\leq 5$ and $x\geq -5$ . So $x$ ranges from $-5$ to $5$ , for a total of $\boxed{\mathbf{(A)}\ 11}$ integer values.
Note by Williamgolly: Alternatively, draw out the circle and see that these points must be on the line $y=-x$ .

## Solution(analytical)
Drawing out the diagram, it becomes apparent that all of the successive points are on the line $y=-x$ . Since the lowest point of the circle is ( $5$ , $5-10=-5$ ), and the point most to the left is ( $5-10=-5$ , $5$ ), we see that these $2$ points and the origin are collinear, meaning every point in between the $2$ extreme points of the circle works, inclusive. We have $-5 \le x \le 5$ , so counting them or using $5-(-5)+1$ , we have $\boxed{\mathbf{(A)}\ 11}$ integer values.
