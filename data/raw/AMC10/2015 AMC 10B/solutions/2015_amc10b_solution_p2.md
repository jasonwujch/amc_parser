# 2015 AMC 10B Problem 2

## Problem

Marie does three equally time-consuming tasks in a row without taking breaks. She begins the first task at $1\!:\!00$ PM and finishes the second task at $2\!:\!40$ PM. When does she finish the third task?

$\textbf{(A) }\text{3:10 PM}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\text{3:30 PM}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\text{4:00 PM}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\text{4:10 PM}\qquad\textbf{(E) }\text{4:30 PM}$

## Solution
Marie finishes $2$ tasks in $1$ hour and $40$ minutes. Therefore, one task should take $50$ minutes to finish. $50$ minutes after $2\!:\!40$ PM is $3\!:\!30$ PM, so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\text{3:30 PM}}$
