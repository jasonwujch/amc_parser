# 2015 AMC 10B Problem 3

## Problem

Isaac has written down one integer two times and another integer three times. The sum of the five numbers is $100$ , and one of the numbers is $28.$ What is the other number?

$\textbf{(A) }8\qquad\textbf{(B) }11\qquad\textbf{(C) }14\qquad\textbf{(D) }15\qquad\textbf{(E) }18$

## Solution
Let the first number be $x$ and the second be $y$ . We have $2x+3y=100$ . We are given one of the numbers is $28$ . If $x$ were to be $28$ , $y$ would not be an integer, thus $y=28$ . $2x+3(28)=100$ , which gives $x=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }8}$ .
