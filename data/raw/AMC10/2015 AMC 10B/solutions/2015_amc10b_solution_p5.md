# 2015 AMC 10B Problem 5

## Problem

David, Hikmet, Jack, Marta, Rand, and Todd were in a $12$ -person race with $6$ other people. Rand finished $6$ places ahead of Hikmet. Marta finished $1$ place behind Jack. David finished $2$ places behind Hikmet. Jack finished $2$ places behind Todd. Todd finished $1$ place behind Rand. Marta finished in $6$ th place. Who finished in $8$ th place?

$\textbf{(A) } \text{David} \qquad\textbf{(B) } \text{Hikmet} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \text{Jack} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \text{Rand} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \text{Todd}$

## Solution
Because Marta was $6$ th, Jack was $5$ th, so Todd was $3$ rd. Thus, Rand was $2$ nd and the 8th place finisher was $\boxed{\mathbf{(B)}\ \mathrm{Hikmet}}$
