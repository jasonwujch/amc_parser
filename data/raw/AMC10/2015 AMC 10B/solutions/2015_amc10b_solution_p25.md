# 2015 AMC 10B Problem 25

## Problem

A rectangular box measures $a \times b \times c$ , where $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are integers and $1\leq a \leq b \leq c$ . The volume and the surface area of the box are numerically equal. How many ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ are possible?

$\textbf{(A)}\; 4 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\; 10 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\; 12 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\; 21 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\; 26$

## Solution 1
We need \[abc = 2(ab+bc+ac) \quad \text{ or } \quad (a-2)bc = 2a(b+c).\] Since $a\le b$ and $a,b,c$ are all positive $,ac \le bc$ . From the first equation we get $abc \le 6bc$ . Thus $a\le 6$ . From the second equation we see that $a > 2$ . Thus $a\in \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$ . For the following we need the resulting $(b,c)$ to be positive integers and $b$ and $c$ to satisfy the condition $1\leq a \leq b \leq c.$
- If $a=3$ we need $bc = 6(b+c) \Rightarrow (b-6)(c-6)=36$ . We get five roots $\{(3, 7, 42), (3, 8, 24), (3,9,18), (3, 10, 15), (3,12,12)\}$ .
- If $a=4$ we need $2bc = 8(b+c) \Rightarrow bc = 4(b+c) \Rightarrow (b-4)(c-4)=16$ . We get three roots $\{(4,5,20), (4,6,12), (4,8,8)\}$ .
- If $a=5$ we need $3bc = 10(b+c) \Rightarrow 9bc=30(b+c) \Rightarrow (3b-10)(3c-10)=100$ . We get one root $\{(5,5,10)\}$ .
- If $a=6$ we need $4bc = 12(b+c) \Rightarrow bc = 3(b+c) \Rightarrow (b-3)(c-3)=9$ . We get one root $\{(6,6,6)\}$ .
Thus, there are $5+3+1+1 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\; 10}$ solutions.
### Supplement
Another method for finding the upper bound of $a$ is to multiply $abc = 2(ab+bc+ac)$ by three, allowing us to factor the expression into $ab(c-6) + bc(a-6) + ca(b-6) = 0$ . When $a > 6$ , all terms are clearly greater than $0$ , as $a, b , c$ must be positive. Therefore, we arrive at a contradiction, and $a \leq 6$ .

## Solution 2
The surface area is $2(ab+bc+ca)$ , and the volume is $abc$ , so equating the two yields
\[2(ab+bc+ca)=abc.\]
Divide both sides by $2abc$ to obtain \[\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{1}{2}.\]
First consider the bound of the variable $a$ . Since $\frac{1}{a}<\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{1}{2},$ we have $a>2$ , or $a\geqslant3$ .
Also note that $c \geq b \geq a > 0$ , hence $\frac{1}{a} \geq \frac{1}{b} \geq \frac{1}{c}$ . Thus, $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{3}{a}$ , so $a \leq 6$ .
So we have $a=3, 4, 5$ or $6$ .
Before the casework, let's consider the possible range for $b$ if $\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=k>0$ . From $\frac{1}{b}<k$ , we have $b>\frac{1}{k}$ . From $\frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=k$ , we have $b \leq \frac{2}{k}$ . Thus $\frac{1}{k}<b \leq \frac{2}{k}$ .
When $a=3$ , we get $\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{1}{6}$ , so $b=7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$ . We find the solutions $(a, b, c)=(3, 7, 42)$ , $(3, 8, 24)$ , $(3, 9, 18)$ , $(3, 10, 15)$ , $(3, 12, 12)$ , for a total of $5$ solutions.
When $a=4$ , we get $\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{1}{4}$ , so $b=5, 6, 7, 8$ . We find the solutions $(a, b, c)=(4, 5, 20)$ , $(4, 6, 12)$ , $(4, 8, 8)$ , for a total of $3$ solutions.
When $a=5$ , we get $\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{3}{10}$ , so $b=5, 6$ . The only solution in this case is $(a, b, c)=(5, 5, 10)$ .
When $a=6$ , $b$ is forced to be $6$ , and thus $(a, b, c)=(6, 6, 6)$ .
Thus, there are $5+3+1+1 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\; 10}$ solutions.

## Simplification of Solution 2
The surface area is $2(ab+bc+ca)$ , the volume is $abc$ , so $2(ab+bc+ca)=abc$ .
Divide both sides by $2abc$ , we have: \[\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{1}{2}.\] First consider the bound of the variable $a$ . Since $\frac{1}{a}<\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{1}{2},$ we have $a>2$ , or $a\ge 3$ .
Also note that $c\ge b\ge a>0$ , we have $\frac{1}{a}\ge \frac{1}{b}\ge \frac{1}{c}$ . Thus, $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\le \frac{3}{a}$ , so $a\le 6$ .
So we have $a=3, 4, 5$ or $6$ .
We can say $\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=\frac{1}{q}$ , where $\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{a}$ .
Notice $\emph{\text{immediately}}$ that $b, c > q$ . This is our key step. Then we can say $b=q+d$ , $c=q+e$ . If we clear the fraction about b and c (do the math), our immediate result is that $de = q^2$ . Realize also that $d \leq e$ .
Now go through cases for $a$ and you end up with the same result. However, now you don't have to guess solutions. For example, when $a=3$ , then $de = 36$ and $d=1, 2, 3, 4, 6$ .
