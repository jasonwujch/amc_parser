## Solution 1
Use synthetic division to find that the remainder of $x^{3}+x^{2}+ax+b$ is $a+b+2$ when divided by $x-1$ and $2a+b+12$ when divided by $x-2$ . Now, we solve
\[\begin{cases} a+b+2=4 \\ 2a+b+12 = 6 \\ \end{cases}\]
This ends up being $a=-8$ , $b=10$ , so $b-a=10-(-8)=\fbox{\textbf{(E)} 18}$

## Solution 2
Via the remainder theorem, we can plug $1$ in for the factor $x-1$ and get $4$ , so we have that \[1^3+1^2+1a+b=4\] \[a+b=2.\] Then, we plug in $2$ and get a remainder of $6$ , so we have that \[2^3+2^2+2a+b=6\] \[8+4+2a+b=6\] \[2a+b=-6\] Then, we solve the system of equations. By substitution, we obtain \[b=2-a\] \[2a+2-a=-6\] \[a=-8\] \[b=2-(-8)=2+8=10.\] Thus, we have that $b-a=10-(-8)=10+8=\fbox{\textbf{(E)} 18}$

## Solution 3 (Small)
Using Remainder theorem, we get that: $4 = (1)^3 + (1)^2 + (1)a + b = 1 + 1 + a + b$ so we get $2 = a + b$ (i) and from the second statement, $6 = (2)^3 + (2)^2 + (2)a + b = 8 + 4 + 2a + b$ so we get $-6 = 2a + b$ (ii).
So we Subtract (ii) from (i) to get $a = -8$ . Substitute in to get $b = 10$ .
So $b - a = 10 - (-8) = \fbox{\textbf{(E)} 18}$
