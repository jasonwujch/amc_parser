# 2025 AMC 10A Problem 24

## Problem

Call a positive integer fair if no digit is used more than once, it has no $0$ s, and no digit is adjacent to two greater digits. For example, $196, 23$ and $12463$ are fair, but $1546, 320,$ and $34321$ are not. How many fair positive integers are there?

$\textbf{(A) } 511 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 2584 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 9841 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 17711 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 19682$

## Solution 1
To satisfy the conditions, a $\textit{fair}$ integer must have no digit be a local minimum. Let's say we have $n$ distinct digits, with each digit being a number from $1$ to $9$ . To create a $\textit{fair}$ integer, we begin by placing the largest digit. For the second-largest digit, we can either place this digit to the right or to the left of the string already created. We have these $2$ options for the third-largest digit, and so on. Therefore, there are $2^{n-1}$ valid permutations to create a $\textit{fair}$ integer.
We must also choose which digits will be in the permutation. If you are creating an $n$ -digit long $\textit{fair}$ integer, there are $9\choose{n}$ ways to pick which digits will be in the number.
Therefore, for each $n \in \{1,2,\dots, 9\}$ , the number of fair integers of length $n$ is: \[\binom{9}{n} \cdot 2^{n-1}.\] Summing over all $n$ : \[\sum_{n=1}^9{\binom{9}{n} \cdot 2^{n-1}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{n=0}^9{\binom{9}{n}}2^n -1\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left((1+2)^9 -1 \right) = \frac{1}{2}(19682) = \boxed{9841}.\] Note that the Binomial Theorem was used to equate \[\sum_{n=0}^9{\binom{9}{n}}2^n = (1+2)^9.\] ~lprado

## Solution 2
Note every $\textit{fair}$ number will have an increasing string of digits, a maximum digit, then a decreasing string of digits. This is because if it decreases then increases, then the digit in the middle will be less than its adjacent digits.
Let $n$ be the maximum digit. For each number $i<n$ , we may either place $i$ before $n$ , after $n$ , or choose not to include it. Note this process will result in a unique number for every case, as the numbers before $n$ must be in increasing order, and the numbers after $n$ must be in decreasing order. Therefore, for each number $n$ , we have $3^{n-1}$ cases.
Since $n \in \{1,2,\cdots9\}$ , we have: \[\sum_{n=1}^9 3^{n-1}=\frac{3^9-1}{3-1}=\boxed{9841}.\]

## Solution 2.5 (Cheese)
If you consider options D and E too large, and A and B too small, then C is your answer.
$\boxed {\text {(C) } 9841}$ Also E is twice C so c is your answer

## Solution 3 (Recursion)
Let $f(n)$ be the number of fair integers given an arbitrary set of $n$ digits. Let $a$ be the smallest of these digits. Notice that $a$ is either the first or last digit, as if it were any other digit, the two digits surroudning it would both be greater. Then, notice that if the remaining $n-1$ slots form a fair number, so does the number when $a$ is appended. Therefore, $f(n) = 2f(n-1)$ . From here, we may proceed with the calculation in Solution $1$ to get the answer of $\boxed {\text {(C) } 9841}$

## Solution 4 (Two for one)
For any fair integer $n$ , we write some $9$ -digit base- $3$ number(s) $f(n)=\left(\overline{d_1 d_2 \ldots d_9}\right)_3$ from left to right as follows:
- $d_k=0$ if $k$ is not in $n$ ;
- $d_k=1$ if $k$ is the to the left of all digits greater than $k$ in $n$ ;
- $d_k=2$ if $k$ is the to the right of all digits greater than $k$ in $n$ .
Note that the fairness ensured one and only one of the above three cases happens.
Now if $k$ is the largest digit in $n$ then $d_k$ can be either $1$ or $2$ .
An example: If $n=136852$ , then $f(n)=\overline{121021010}_3$ or $\overline{121021020}_3$ .
It's easy to see that there is a $1$ -to- $2$ mapping from all fair integers to all $9$ -digit base- $3$ nonzero numbers. Therefore the answer is $\frac{3^9-1}{2}$ .
