## Problem

A basketball player made 5 baskets during a game. Each basket was worth either 2 or 3 points. How many different numbers could represent the total points scored by the player?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 2\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 3\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 4\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 5\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 6$

## Solution
The number of points could have been 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15. This is because the minimum is 2*5=10 and the maximum is 3*5=15. The numbers between 10 and 15 are possible as well. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 6}$ .
