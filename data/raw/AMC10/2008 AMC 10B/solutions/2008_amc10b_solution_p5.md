## Problem

For real numbers $a$ and $b$ , define $a * b=(a-b)^2$ . What is $(x-y)^2*(y-x)^2$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 0\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ x^2+y^2\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 2x^2\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 2y^2\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 4xy$

## Solution
Since $(-a)^2 = a^2$ , it follows that $(x-y)^2 = (y-x)^2$ , and \[(x-y)^2 * (y-x)^2 = [(x-y)^2 - (y-x)^2]^2 = [(x-y)^2 - (x-y)^2]^2 = 0\ \mathrm{(A)}.\]
