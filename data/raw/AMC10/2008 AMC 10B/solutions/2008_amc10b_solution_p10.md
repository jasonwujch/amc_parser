# 2008 AMC 10B Problem 10

## Problem

Points $A$ and $B$ are on a circle of radius $5$ and $AB=6$ . Point $C$ is the midpoint of the minor arc $AB$ . What is the length of the line segment $AC$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \sqrt{10}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{7}{2}\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \sqrt{14}\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \sqrt{15}\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 4$

## Solution
Let the center of the circle be $O$ , and let $D$ be the intersection of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{OC}$ (then $D$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ ). $OA=OB=5$ , since they are both radii of the circle.
By the Pythagorean Theorem , $OD = \sqrt{OA^2 - DA^2} = 4$ , and by subtraction, $CD=OC - OD = 1$ .
Using the Pythagorean Theorem again, $AC= \sqrt{AD^2 + CD^2} = \sqrt{3^2+1^2}=\sqrt{10} \Longrightarrow \textbf{(A)}$ .
