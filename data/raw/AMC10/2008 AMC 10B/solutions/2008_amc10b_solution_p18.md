# 2008 AMC 10B Problem 18

## Problem

Bricklayer Brenda takes $9$ hours to build a chimney alone, and bricklayer Brandon takes $10$ hours to build it alone. When they work together, they talk a lot, and their combined output decreases by $10$ bricks per hour. Working together, they build the chimney in $5$ hours. How many bricks are in the chimney?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 500\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 900\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 950\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 1000\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 1900$

## Solution
Let $x$ be the number of bricks in the chimney. The work done is the rate multiplied by the time.
Using $w = rt$ , we get $x = \left(\frac{x}{9} + \frac{x}{10} - 10\right)\cdot(5)$ . Solving for $x$ , we get $900$ , or $\boxed{B}$ .
