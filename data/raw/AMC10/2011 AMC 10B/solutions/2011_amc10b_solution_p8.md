## Problem

At a certain beach if it is at least $80^{\circ} F$ and sunny, then the beach will be crowded. On June 10 the beach was not crowded. What can be concluded about the weather conditions on June 10?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{The temperature was cooler than } 80^{\circ} \text{F and it was not sunny.}$

$\textbf{(B)}\ \text{The temperature was cooler than } 80^{\circ} \text{F or it was not sunny.}$

$\textbf{(C)}\ \text{If the temperature was at least } 80^{\circ} \text{F, then it was sunny.}$

$\textbf{(D)}\ \text{If the temperature was cooler than } 80^{\circ} \text{F, then it was sunny.}$

$\textbf{(E)}\ \text{If the temperature was cooler than } 80^{\circ} \text{F, then it was not sunny.}$

## Solution
The beach not being crowded only means that it is not both hot and sunny. Equivalently, it is either cool or cloudy, which means $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$ is correct.
It could be in fact cool and sunny, which would violate (A) and (E) . It could also be cool and cloudy, which would violate (D) , or hot and cloudy, which would violate (C) .
