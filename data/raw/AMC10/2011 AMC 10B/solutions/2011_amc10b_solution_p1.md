## Problem

What is \[\dfrac{2+4+6}{1+3+5} - \dfrac{1+3+5}{2+4+6} ?\]

$\textbf{(A)}\ -1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{5}{36}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{7}{12}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{147}{60}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{43}{3}$

## Solution
$\dfrac{2+4+6}{1+3+5} - \dfrac{1+3+5}{2+4+6} = \dfrac{12}{9} - \dfrac{9}{12} = \dfrac{4}{3} - \dfrac{3}{4} = \boxed{\dfrac{7}{12}\; \textbf{(C)}}$
