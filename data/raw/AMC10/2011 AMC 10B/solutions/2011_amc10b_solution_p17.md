## Problem

In the given circle, the diameter $\overline{EB}$ is parallel to $\overline{DC}$ , and $\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\overline{ED}$ . The angles $AEB$ and $ABE$ are in the ratio $4 : 5$ . What is the degree measure of angle $BCD$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 120 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 125 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 130 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 135 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 140$

## Solution 1
We can let $\angle AEB$ be $4x$ and $\angle ABE$ be $5x$ because they are in the ratio $4 : 5$ . When an inscribed angle contains the diameter , the inscribed angle is a right angle . Therefore by triangle sum theorem, $4x+5x+90=180 \longrightarrow x=10$ and $\angle ABE = 50$ .
$\angle ABE = \angle BED$ because they are alternate interior angles and $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{ED}$ . Opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary , so $\angle BED + \angle BCD = 180$ . Use substitution to get $\angle ABE + \angle BCD = 180 \longrightarrow 50 + \angle BCD = 180 \longrightarrow \angle BCD = \boxed{\textbf{(C)} 130}$
### Note:
We could also tell that quadrilateral $BEDC$ is an isosceles trapezoid because for $\overline{EB}$ and $\overline{DC}$ to be parallel, the line going through the center of the circle and perpendicular to $\overline{DC}$ must fall through the center of $\overline{DC}$ .

## Solution 2
Note $\angle ABE = \angle BED=50$ as before. The sum of the interior angles for quadrilateral $EBCD$ is $360$ . Denote the center of the circle as $P$ . $\angle PDE = \angle PED = 50$ . Denote $\angle PDC = \angle PCD = x$ and $\angle PBC = \angle PCB = y$ . We wish to find $\angle BCD = x+y$ . Our equation is $(\angle PDE +\angle PED)+(\angle PDC+\angle PCD)+(\angle PBC + \angle PCB) = 360 \longrightarrow 2(50) + 2x +2y = 360$ . Our final equation becomes $2(x+y)+100 = 360$ . After subtracting $100$ and dividing by $2$ , our answer becomes $x+y=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} 130}$

## Solution 3 (Circle Geometry)
Note that $\overset{\Large\frown} {BE}$ intercepts $\angle BAE$ . Since, $\overset{\Large\frown} {BE}=180$ , thus $\angle BAE=90°$ (courtesy of the Inscribed Angles Theorem).
Since we know that $\angle BAE=90°$ , then $\angle AEB + \angle ABE = 90°$ , (courtesy of the Triangle Sum Theorem) and also $5\angle AEB = 4\angle ABE$ . By solving this variation, $\angle AEB = 40$ and $\angle ABE = 50$ . After that, due to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, $\angle ABE \cong \angle BED$ , which means $\angle BED = 50$ .
After doing some angle chasing, then these following facts should be true, $\overset{\Large\frown} {AB}=80$ $\overset{\Large\frown} {BD}=100$ $\overset{\Large\frown} {AE}=100$ .
Note that the arcs have to equal 360, so, $360=\overset{\Large\frown} {AB}+\overset{\Large\frown} {BD}+\overset{\Large\frown} {DE}+\overset{\Large\frown} {AE}$
$360=80+100+100+\overset{\Large\frown} {DE}$
$\overset{\Large\frown} {DE}=80$
Notice how $\overset{\Large\frown} {DB}$ intercepts $\angle BCD$ and that $\overset{\Large\frown} {DB}=\overset{\Large\frown} {DE}+\overset{\Large\frown} {AE}+\overset{\Large\frown} {AB}$ .
$\overset{\Large\frown} {DB}=80+100+80$
$\overset{\Large\frown} {DB}=260$
According to the Inscribed Angles Theorem, $2\angle BCD=\overset{\Large\frown} {DB}$ , therefore the answer is $\frac{260}{2}= \boxed{\textbf{(C)} 130}$
