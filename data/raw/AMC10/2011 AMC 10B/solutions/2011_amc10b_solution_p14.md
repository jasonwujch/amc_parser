## Problem

A rectangular parking lot has a diagonal of $25$ meters and an area of $168$ square meters. In meters, what is the perimeter of the parking lot?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 52 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 58 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 62 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 68 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 70$

## Solution
Let the sides of the rectangular parking lot be $a$ and $b$ . Then $a^2 + b^2 = 625$ and $ab = 168$ . Add the two equations together, then factor. \begin{align*} a^2 + 2ab + b^2 &= 625 + 168 \times 2\\ (a + b)^2 &= 961\\ a + b &= 31 \end{align*} The perimeter of a rectangle is $2 (a + b) = 2 (31) = \boxed{\textbf{(C)} 62}$

## Solution 2 (Quick)
We see the answer choices or the perimeter are integers. Therefore, the sides of the rectangle are most likely integers that satisfy $a^2+b^2=25^2$ . In other words, $(a,b,25)$ is a set of Pythagorean triples. Guessing and checking, we have $(7,24,25)$ as the triplet, as the area is $7 \cdot 24 = 168$ as requested. Therefore, the perimeter is $2(7+24)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} 62}$ .
