# 2009 AMC 10A Problem 9

## Problem

Positive integers $a$ , $b$ , and $2009$ , with $a<b<2009$ , form a geometric sequence with an integer ratio. What is $a$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 7 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 41 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 49 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 289 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 2009$

## Solution
The prime factorization of $2009$ is $2009 = 7\cdot 7\cdot 41$ . As $a<b<2009$ , the ratio must be positive and larger than $1$ , hence there is only one possibility: the ratio must be $7$ , and then $b=7\cdot 41$ , and $a=41\Rightarrow\fbox{B}$ .
We know that this is important because the complete equation would be $a\cdot x^2=2009,$ and the only possible outcome for $x$ is $7.$ -Edited slightly by RealityWrites - minor $\LaTeX$ edits by BS2012
