# 2009 AMC 10A Problem 19

## Problem

Circle $A$ has radius $100$ . Circle $B$ has an integer radius $r<100$ and remains internally tangent to circle $A$ as it rolls once around the circumference of circle $A$ . The two circles have the same points of tangency at the beginning and end of circle $B$ 's trip. How many possible values can $r$ have?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 4\ \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 8\ \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 9\ \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 50\ \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 90\ \qquad$

## Solution
The circumference of circle $A$ is $200\pi$ , and the circumference of circle $B$ with radius $r$ is $2r\pi$ . Since circle $B$ makes a complete revolution and ends up on the same point , the circumference of $A$ must be a multiple of the circumference of $B$ , therefore the quotient must be an integer.
Thus, $\frac{200\pi}{2\pi \cdot r} = \frac{100}{r}$ .
Therefore $r$ must then be a factor of $100$ , excluding $100$ because the problem says that $r<100$ . $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$ . Therefore $100$ has $(2+1) \cdot (2+1)$ factors*. But you need to subtract $1$ from $9$ , in order to exclude $100$ . Therefore the answer is $\boxed{8}$ .
