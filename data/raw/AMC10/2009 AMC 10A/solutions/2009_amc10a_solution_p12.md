# 2009 AMC 10A Problem 12

## Problem

In quadrilateral $ABCD$ , $AB = 5$ , $BC = 17$ , $CD = 5$ , $DA = 9$ , and $BD$ is an integer. What is $BD$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 11 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 12 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 13 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 14 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution
By the triangle inequality we have $BD < DA + AB = 9 + 5 = 14$ , and also $BD + CD > BC$ , hence $BD > BC - CD = 17 - 5 = 12$ .
We get that $12 < BD < 14$ , and as we know that $BD$ is an integer, we must have $BD=\boxed{13}$ .
