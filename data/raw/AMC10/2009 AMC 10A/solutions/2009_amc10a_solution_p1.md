## Problem

One can holds $12$ ounces of soda, what is the minimum number of cans needed to provide a gallon ( $128$ ounces) of soda?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 7\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 8\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 9\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 10\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 11$

## Solution 1
$10$ cans would hold $120$ ounces, but $128>120$ , so $11$ cans are required. Thus, the answer is $\mathrm{\boxed{{(E)}11}}$ .

## Solution 2
We want to find $\left\lceil\frac{128}{12}\right\rceil$ because there are a whole number of cans.
$\frac{128}{12} = 10R8\longrightarrow 11\longrightarrow \fbox{(E)}.$
