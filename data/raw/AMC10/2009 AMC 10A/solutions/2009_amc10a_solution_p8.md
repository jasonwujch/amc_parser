## Problem

Three generations of the Wen family are going to the movies, two from each generation. The two members of the youngest generation receive a $50$ % discount as children. The two members of the oldest generation receive a $25\%$ discount as senior citizens. The two members of the middle generation receive no discount. Grandfather Wen, whose senior ticket costs $\$6.00$ , is paying for everyone. How many dollars must he pay?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 34 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 36 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 42 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 46 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 48$

## Solution
A senior ticket costs $\$6.00$ , so a regular ticket costs $6 \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{3}{4}}\:=\:6\cdot\frac{4}{3}\:=\:8$ dollars. Therefore children's tickets cost half that, or $\$4.00$ , so we have:
$2(6+8+4)\:=\:36$
So Grandfather Wen pays $\$36$ , or $\fbox{B}$ .

## Solution 2
Using average, we know that assuming the middle-aged people's ticket cost x dollars, $2\cdot(100\%x+75\%x+50\%x)$ . We average this into 2*(75%x+75%x+75%x). We know that 75%x=6.00, which means $6\cdot6$ is the answer, or 36. -RealityWrites
