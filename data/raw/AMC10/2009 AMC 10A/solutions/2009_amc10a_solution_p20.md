# 2009 AMC 10A Problem 20

## Problem

Andrea and Lauren are $20$ kilometers apart. They bike toward one another with Andrea traveling three times as fast as Lauren, and the distance between them decreasing at a rate of $1$ kilometer per minute. After $5$ minutes, Andrea stops biking because of a flat tire and waits for Lauren. After how many minutes from the time they started to bike does Lauren reach Andrea?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 20 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 30 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 55 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 65 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 80$

## Solution 1
Let their speeds in kilometers per hour be $v_A$ and $v_L$ . We know that $v_A=3v_L$ and that $v_A+v_L=60$ . (The second equation follows from the fact that $1\mathrm km/min = 60\mathrm km/h$ .) This solves to $v_A=45$ and $v_L=15$ .
As the distance decreases at a rate of $1$ kilometer per minute, after $5$ minutes the distance between them will be $20-5=15$ kilometers.
From this point on, only Lauren will be riding her bike. As there are $15$ kilometers remaining and $v_L=15$ , she will need exactly an hour to get to Andrea. Therefore the total time in minutes is $5+60 = \boxed{65}$ .

## Solution 2
Because the speed of Andrea is 3 times as fast as Lauren and the distance between them is decreasing at a rate of 1 kilometer per minute, Andrea's speed is $\frac{3}{4} \textbf{km/min}$ , and Lauren's $\frac{1}{4} \textbf{km/min}$ . Therefore, after 5 minutes, Andrea will have biked $\frac{3}{4} \cdot 5 = \frac{15}{4}km$ .
In all, Lauren will have to bike $20 - \frac{15}{4} = \frac{80}{4} - \frac{15}{4} = \frac{65}{4}km$ . Because her speed is $\frac{1}{4} \textbf{km/min}$ , the time elapsed will be $\frac{\frac{65}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \boxed{\textbf{D) 65}}$

## Solution 3
Since the distance between them decreases at a rate of $1$ kilometer per minute when they are both biking, their combined speed is $1$ kilometer per minute. Andrea travels three times as fast as Lauren, so they travel at speeds of $\frac{3}{4}$ kilometers per minute and $\frac{1}{4}$ kilometers per minute, respectively.
After $5$ minutes, the distance between them will have decreased by $5$ kilometers, so they will be $20-5 = 15$ kilometers apart when Andrea stops. Then, Lauren will take $\frac{15}{\frac{1}{4}} = 15*4=60$ more minutes to reach Andrea.
They started to bike $5$ minutes before Andrea stopped, so the total time Lauren passed from the time they started biking to the time Lauren reached Andrea is $60+5=65$ minutes. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 65}$ . ~azc1027
