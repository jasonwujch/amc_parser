# 2021 AMC 10B Problem 4

## Problem

At a math contest, $57$ students are wearing blue shirts, and another $75$ students are wearing yellow shirts. The $132$ students are assigned into $66$ pairs. In exactly $23$ of these pairs, both students are wearing blue shirts. In how many pairs are both students wearing yellow shirts?

$\textbf{(A)} ~23 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~32 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~37 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~41 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~64$

## Solution
There are $46$ blue students paired with a blue partner. The other $11$ students wearing blue shirts must each be paired with a partner wearing a shirt of the opposite color. There are $64$ yellow students remaining. Therefore the requested number of pairs is $\tfrac{64}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)} ~32}$
