# 2021 AMC 10B Problem 2

## Problem

What is the value of $\sqrt{\left(3-2\sqrt{3}\right)^2}+\sqrt{\left(3+2\sqrt{3}\right)^2}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)} ~0 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~4\sqrt{3}-6 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~6 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~4\sqrt{3} \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~4\sqrt{3}+6$

## Solution 1
Note that the square root of any number squared is always the absolute value of the squared number because the square root function will only return a nonnegative number. By squaring both $3$ and $2\sqrt{3}$ , we see that $2\sqrt{3}>3$ , thus $3-2\sqrt{3}$ is negative, so we must take the absolute value of $3-2\sqrt{3}$ , which is just $2\sqrt{3}-3$ . Knowing this, the first term in the expression equals $2\sqrt{3}-3$ and the second term is $3+2\sqrt3$ , and summing the two gives $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~4\sqrt{3}}$ .

## Solution 2
Let $x = \sqrt{(3-2\sqrt{3})^2}+\sqrt{(3+2\sqrt{3})^2}$ , then $x^2 = (3-2\sqrt{3})^2+2\sqrt{(-3)^2}+(3+2\sqrt3)^2$ . The $2\sqrt{(-3)^2}$ term is there due to difference of squares when you simplify $2ab$ from $(a + b)^2$ . Simplifying the expression gives us $x^2 = 48$ , so $x=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~4\sqrt{3}}$ ~ shrungpatel

## Solution 3 (Memorizing Roots)
Memorizing your square roots from 1 - 10 are really important for cheesing some AMC problems, so try to memorize them.
\( \sqrt{3} \) is about 1.7.
We then substitute \( \sqrt{3} \) for 1.7 to solve this.
We get
\[\sqrt{(3-2 \cdot 1.7)^2} + \sqrt{(3+2 \cdot 1.7)^2}\]
\[= \sqrt{(-0.4)^2} + \sqrt{(6.4)^2}\]
\[= \sqrt{0.16} + \sqrt{6.4^2}\]
\[= 0.4 + 6.4\]
\[= 6.8\]
Looking at the answer choices, we see that $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~4\sqrt{3}}$ gives $6.8$ for when \( \sqrt{3} = 1.7 \).
