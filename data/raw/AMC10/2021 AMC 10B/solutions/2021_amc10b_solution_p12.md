## Problem

Let $N = 34 \cdot 34 \cdot 63 \cdot 270$ . What is the ratio of the sum of the odd divisors of $N$ to the sum of the even divisors of $N$ ?

$\textbf{(A)} ~1 : 16 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~1 : 15 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~1 : 14 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~1 : 8 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~1 : 3$

## Solution 1
Prime factorize $N$ to get $N=2^{3} \cdot 3^{5} \cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 17^{2}$ . For each odd divisor $n$ of $N$ , there exist even divisors $2n, 4n, 8n$ of $N$ , therefore the ratio is $1:(2+4+8)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~1 : 14}$

## Solution 2
Prime factorizing $N$ , we see $N=2^{3} \cdot 3^{5} \cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 17^{2}$ . The sum of $N$ 's odd divisors are the sum of the factors of $N$ without $2$ , and the sum of the even divisors is the sum of the odds subtracted by the total sum of divisors.
BY SUM OF FACTORS FORMULA (search it up if you don't know): The formula is actually for all factors, but we can just take out the $2^3$ , so we have:
The sum of odd divisors is given by \[a = (1+3+3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5)(1 + 5)(1+7)(1+17+17^2)\] and the total sum of divisors is \[(1+2+4+8)(1+3+3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5)(1 + 5)(1+7)(1+17+17^2) = 15a.\] Thus, our ratio is \[\frac{a}{15a-a} = \frac{a}{14a} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~1 : 14}.\]

## Solution 3
Prime factorizing $N$ , we have that there is $2^3$ in our factorization. Now, call the sum of the odd divisors $k$ . We know that if we multiply k by 2, we will have even divisors. So, we can multiply k by 2, $2^2, 2^3$ respectively to get 14k as the sum of the even divisors. Therefore, the answer is \[\frac{k}{14k} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~1:14}.\] ~MC
