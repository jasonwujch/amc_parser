# 2021 AMC 10B Problem 3

## Problem

In an after-school program for juniors and seniors, there is a debate team with an equal number of students from each class on the team. Among the $28$ students in the program, $25\%$ of the juniors as a class and $10\%$ of the seniors as a class are on the debate team. How many juniors are in the program?

$\textbf{(A)} ~5 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~6 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~8 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~11 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~20$

## Solution 1
Say there are $j$ juniors and $s$ seniors in the program. Converting percentages to fractions, $\frac{j}{4}$ and $\frac{s}{10}$ are on the debate team, and since an equal number of juniors and seniors are on the debate team, $\frac{j}{4} = \frac{s}{10}.$
Cross-multiplying and simplifying we get $5j=2s.$ Additionally, since there are $28$ students in the program, $j+s = 28.$ It is now a matter of solving the system of equations \[5j=2s\] \[j+s=28,\] and the solution is $j = 8, s = 20.$ Since we want the number of juniors, the answer is \[\boxed{(C) \text{ } 8}.\]

## Solution 2 (Logic)
Clearly, the number of seniors must be a number divisible by $10$ , since $10\%$ points to a whole number, so the number of seniors must be either $10$ or $20$ . If there are ten seniors, there is $1$ senior on the debate team, which would mean that there are $4$ juniors, since $10\%s$ = $25\%j$ . This is impossible, so the number of seniors is 20, and the number of juniors is $28-20=8\rightarrow \boxed{C}$ .
Note that by using the answer choices, we could automatically rule out 10.

## Solution 3
Since there are an equal number of juniors and seniors on the debate team, suppose there are $x$ juniors and $x$ seniors. This number represents $25\% =\frac{1}{4}$ of the juniors and $10\%= \frac{1}{10}$ of the seniors, which tells us that there are $4x$ juniors and $10x$ seniors. There are $28$ juniors and seniors in the program altogether, so we get \[10x+4x=28,\] \[14x=28,\] \[x=2.\] Which means there are $4x=8$ juniors on the debate team, $\boxed{\text{(C)} \, 8}$ .

## Solution 4 (Elimination)
The amount of juniors must be a multiple of $4$ , since exactly $\frac{1}{4}$ of the students are on the debate team. Thus, we can immediately see that $\boxed{C}$ and $\boxed{E}$ are the only possibilities for the number of juniors. However, if there are $20$ juniors, then there are $8$ seniors, so it is not true that $1/10$ of the seniors are on the debate team, since $\frac{1}{10} \cdot 8 = \frac{4}{5}$ , which is not an integer. Thus, we conclude that there are $8$ juniors, so the answer is $\boxed{C}$ .
