## Problem

The ages of Jonie's four cousins are distinct single-digit positive integers. Two of the cousins' ages multiplied together give $24$ , while the other two multiply to $30$ . What is the sum of the ages of Jonie's four cousins?

$\textbf{(A)} ~21 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~22 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~23 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~24 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~25$

## Solution
First look at the two cousins' ages that multiply to $24$ . Since the ages must be single-digit, the ages must either be $3 \text{ and } 8$ or $4 \text{ and } 6.$
Next, look at the two cousins' ages that multiply to $30$ . Since the ages must be single-digit, the only ages that work are $5 \text{ and } 6.$ Remembering that all the ages must all be distinct, the only solution that works is when the ages are $3, 8$ and $5, 6$ .
We are required to find the sum of the ages, which is \[3 + 8 + 5 + 6 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)} ~22}.\]
