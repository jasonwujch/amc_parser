## Problem

Circle $C_1$ and $C_2$ each have radius $1$ , and the distance between their centers is $\frac{1}{2}$ . Circle $C_3$ is the largest circle internally tangent to both $C_1$ and $C_2$ . Circle $C_4$ is internally tangent to both $C_1$ and $C_2$ and externally tangent to $C_3$ . What is the radius of $C_4$ ?

[asy] import olympiad; size(10cm); draw(circle((0,0),0.75)); draw(circle((-0.25,0),1)); draw(circle((0.25,0),1)); draw(circle((0,6/7),3/28)); pair A = (0,0), B = (-0.25,0), C = (0.25,0), D = (0,6/7), E = (-0.95710678118, 0.70710678118), F = (0.95710678118, -0.70710678118); dot(B^^C); draw(B--E, dashed); draw(C--F, dashed); draw(B--C); label("$C_4$", D); label("$C_1$", (-1.375, 0)); label("$C_2$", (1.375,0)); label("$\frac{1}{2}$", (0, -.125)); label("$C_3$", (-0.4, -0.4)); label("$1$", (-.85, 0.70)); label("$1$", (.85, -.7)); import olympiad; markscalefactor=0.005; [/asy]

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{14} \qquad \textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{12} \qquad \textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{10} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{3}{28} \qquad \textbf{(E) } \frac{1}{9}$

## Solution
[asy] import olympiad; size(10cm); draw(circle((0,0),0.75), gray(0.7)); draw(circle((-0.25,0),1), gray(0.7)); draw(circle((0.25,0),1), gray(0.7)); draw(circle((0,6/7),3/28), gray(0.7)); pair A = (0,0), B = (-0.25,0), C = (0.25,0), D = (0,6/7), EE = (-0.95710678118, 0.70710678118), F = (0.95710678118, -0.70710678118), G = (0,0), T=(0.75,0); dot(D); dot(G); draw(B--EE, dashed+gray(0.7)); draw(C--F, dashed+gray(0.7)); dot(C, gray(0.9)); draw(B--C, gray(0.7)); draw(B--A); draw(A--D); draw(B--D); draw(B--T); label("$\frac{1}{4}$", (-0.125, -0.125)); label("$r + \frac{3}{4}$", (0.2, 3/7)); label("$1 - r$", (-0.29, 3/7)); label("$O$",A,S); label("$A$",B,S); dot("$B$",C,S); dot("$T$",T,E); label("$1$", (-.85, 0.70)); label("$1$", (.85, -.7)); markscalefactor=0.05; [/asy]
Let $O$ be the center of the midpoint of the line segment connecting both the centers, say $A$ and $B$ .
Let the point of tangency with the inscribed circle and the right larger circles be $T$ .
Then $OT = BO + BT = BO + AT - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4}.$
Since $C_4$ is internally tangent to $C_1$ , center of $C_4$ , $C_1$ and their tangent point must be on the same line.
Now, if we connect centers of $C_4$ , $C_3$ and $C_1$ / $C_2$ , we get a right angled triangle.
Let the radius of $C_4$ equal $r$ . With the pythagorean theorem on our triangle, we have
\[\left(r+\frac{3}{4}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2=(1-r)^2\]
Solving this equation gives us
\[r = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac{3}{28}}\]

## Solution 2: Estimation
Draw 2 lines from the middle segment's endpoints to an intersection of $C_1$ and $C_2$ . Draw the perpendicular bisector of the middle segment until it reaches one of the intersections. We see this becomes a right triangle with a hypotenuse of $1$ and one leg length of $\dfrac14$ . Using the Pythagorean theorem, the other leg length is $\dfrac{\sqrt{15}}{4}$ . Also drawing $C_1$ 's radius along the segment of $\dfrac12$ allows us to find the that radius of the middle circle is $\dfrac34$ .
Finally notice that $r_{C_3} + 2 r_{C_4}$ is really close to $\dfrac{\sqrt{15}}{4}$ . $2 r_{C_4} = \dfrac{\sqrt{15} - 3}{4}$ , so $r_{C_4} = \dfrac{\sqrt{15} - 3}{8}$ . This is really close to $\dfrac18$ and the closest answer to that is $\boxed{\text{D) }\dfrac{3}{28}}$
