# 2016 AMC 10B Problem 3

## Problem

Let $x=-2016$ . What is the value of $\Bigg\vert\Big\vert |x|-x\Big\vert-|x|\Bigg\vert-x$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ -2016\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 0\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 2016\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 4032\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 6048$

## Solution 1
Substituting carefully, $\Bigg\vert\Big\vert 2016-(-2016)\Big\vert-2016\Bigg\vert-(-2016)$
becomes $|4032-2016|+2016=2016+2016=4032$ which is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$ .

## Solution 2
Solution by e_power_pi_times_i
Substitute $-y = x = -2016$ into the equation. Now, it is $\Bigg\vert\Big\vert |y|+y\Big\vert-|y|\Bigg\vert+y$ . Since $y = 2016$ , it is a positive number, so $|y| = y$ . Now the equation is $\Bigg\vert\Big\vert y+y\Big\vert-y\Bigg\vert+y$ . This further simplifies to $2y-y+y = 2y$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4032}$
