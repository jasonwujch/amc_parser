# 2016 AMC 10B Problem 6

## Problem

Laura added two three-digit positive integers. All six digits in these numbers are different. Laura's sum is a three-digit number $S$ . What is the smallest possible value for the sum of the digits of $S$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 20$

## Solution 1
Let the two three-digit numbers she added be $a$ and $b$ with $a+b=S$ and $a<b$ . The hundreds digits of these numbers must be at least $1$ and $2$ , so $a\ge 100$ and $b\ge 200$ .
Say $a=100+p$ and $b=200+q$ ; then we just need $p+q=100$ with $p$ and $q$ having different digits which aren't $1$ or $2$ .There are many solutions, but $p=3$ and $q=97$ give $103+297=400$ which proves that $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 4}$ is attainable.

## Solution 2
For this problem, to find the $3$ -digit integer with the smallest sum of digits, one should make the units and tens digit add to $0$ . To do that, we need to make sure the digits are all distinct. For the units digit, we can have a variety of digits that work. $7$ works best for the top number which makes the bottom digit $3$ . The tens digits need to add to $9$ because of the $1$ that needs to be carried from the addition of the units digits. We see that $5$ and $4$ work the best as we can't use $6$ and $3$ . Finally, we use $2$ and $1$ for our hundreds place digits.
Adding the numbers $257$ and $143$ , we get $400$ which means our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 4}$ .
