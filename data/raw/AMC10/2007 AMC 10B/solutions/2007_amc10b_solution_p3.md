# 2007 AMC 10B Problem 3

## Problem

A college student drove his compact car $120$ miles home for the weekend and averaged $30$ miles per gallon. On the return trip the student drove his parents' SUV and averaged only $20$ miles per gallon. What was the average gas mileage, in miles per gallon, for the round trip?

$\textbf{(A) } 22 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 24 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 25 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 26 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 28$

## Solution 1
The trip was $240$ miles long and took $\dfrac{120}{30}+\dfrac{120}{20}=4+6=10$ gallons. Therefore, the average mileage was $\dfrac{240}{10}= \boxed{\textbf{(B) }24}$

## Solution 2
Alternatively, we can use the harmonic mean to get $\frac{2}{\frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{30}} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{12}} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }24}$
