## Problem

Two circles of radius $2$ are centered at $(2,0)$ and at $(0,2).$ What is the area of the intersection of the interiors of the two circles?

$\textbf{(A) } \pi -2 \qquad\textbf{(B) } \frac{\pi}{2} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{3} \qquad\textbf{(D) } 2(\pi -2) \qquad\textbf{(E) } \pi$

## Solution
You can find the area of half the intersection by subtracting the isosceles triangle in the sector from the whole sector. This sector is one-fourth of the area of the circle with radius $2,$ and the isosceles triangle is a right triangle. Therefore, the area of half the intersection is \[\frac{1}{4} 4\pi - \frac{1}{2}(2)(2) = \pi - 2\] That means the area of the whole intersection is $\boxed{\mathrm{(D) \ } 2(\pi-2)}$
