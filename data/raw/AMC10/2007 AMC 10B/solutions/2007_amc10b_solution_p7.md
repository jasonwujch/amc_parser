# 2007 AMC 10B Problem 7

## Problem

All sides of the convex pentagon $ABCDE$ are of equal length, and $\angle A= \angle B = 90^\circ.$ What is the degree measure of $\angle E?$

$\textbf{(A) } 90 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 108 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 120 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 144 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 150$

## Solution
$AB = EC$ because they are opposite sides of a square. Also, $ED = DC = AB$ because all sides of the convex pentagon are of equal length. Since $ABCE$ is a square and $\triangle CED$ is an equilateral triangle, $\angle AEC = 90$ and $\angle CED = 60.$ Use angle addition: \[\angle E = \angle AEC + \angle CED = 90 + 60 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)} 150}\]
