## Problem

A circle of radius $1$ is surrounded by $4$ circles of radius $r$ as shown. What is $r$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } \sqrt{2} \qquad\textbf{(B) } 1+\sqrt{2} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \sqrt{6} \qquad\textbf{(D) } 3 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 2+\sqrt{2}$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
You can express the line connecting the centers of an outer circle and the inner circle in two different ways. You can add the radius of both circles to get $r+1.$ You can also add the radius of two outer circles and use a $45-45-90$ triangle to get $\frac{2r}{\sqrt{2}} = r\sqrt{2}.$ Since both expressions represent the same length, you can set them equal to each other. \begin{align*} r+1&=r\sqrt{2}\\ 1&=r(\sqrt{2}-1)\end{align*} \[r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1} = \frac{1(\sqrt{2}+1)}{(\sqrt{2}-1)(\sqrt{2}+1)} = \frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{2-1} = \boxed{\mathrm{(B) \ } 1 + \sqrt{2}}\]

## Solution 2
You can solve this problem by setting up a simple equation with the Pythagorean Theorem. The hypotenuse would be a segment that includes the radius of two circles on opposite corners and the diameter of the middle circle. This results in a segment of length $2r+2$ . The two legs are each the length between the centers of two large, adjacent circles, thus they are each equal to $2r$ . Using the Pythagorean Theorem: \begin{align*} (2r+2)^2 = 2(2r)^2\\ 4r^2+8r+4=8r^2\\ r^2+2r+1=2r^2\\ r^2-2r-1=0\\ r=\frac{2+\sqrt{4-(-4)}}{2}=\frac{2+2\sqrt{2}}{2}=\boxed{\mathrm{(B) \ } 1 + \sqrt{2}} \end{align*}
