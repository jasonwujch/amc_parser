# 2007 AMC 10B Problem 6

## Problem

The $2007 \text{ AMC }10$ will be scored by awarding $6$ points for each correct response, $0$ points for each incorrect response, and $1.5$ points for each problem left unanswered. After looking over the $25$ problems, Sarah has decided to attempt the first $22$ and leave only the last $3$ unanswered. How many of the first $22$ problems must she solve correctly in order to score at least $100$ points?

$\textbf{(A) } 13 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 14 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 15 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 16 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 17$

## Solution
Sarah is leaving $3$ questions unanswered, guaranteeing her $3 \times 1.5 = 4.5$ points. She will either get $6$ points or $0$ points for the rest of the questions. Let $x$ be the number of questions Sarah answers correctly. \begin{align*} 6x+4.5 &\ge 100\\ 6x &\ge 95.5\\ x &\ge 15.92 \end{align*} The number of questions she answers correctly has to be a whole number, so round up to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$
