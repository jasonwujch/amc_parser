# 2007 AMC 10B Problem 17

## Problem

Point $P$ is inside equilateral $\triangle ABC$ . Points $Q$ , $R$ , and $S$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to $\overline{AB}$ , $\overline{BC}$ , and $\overline{CA}$ , respectively. Given that $PQ=1$ , $PR=2$ , and $PS=3$ , what is $AB$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 4 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 3\sqrt{3} \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 6 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 4\sqrt{3} \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 9$

## Solution 1
Drawing $\overline{PA}$ , $\overline{PB}$ , and $\overline{PC}$ , $\triangle ABC$ is split into three smaller triangles. The altitudes of these triangles are given in the problem as $PQ$ , $PR$ , and $PS$ .
Summing the areas of each of these triangles and equating it to the area of the entire triangle, we get:
\[\frac{s}{2} + \frac{2s}{2} + \frac{3s}{2} = \frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}\] where $s$ is the length of a side of the equilateral triangle
\[s = \boxed{\mathrm{(D) \ } 4\sqrt{3}}\]
- Note - This is called Viviani's Theorem .

## Solution 2
The 60 degree angles suggest constructing 30-60-90 triangles. As such, let the foot of the altitude from $Q$ to $\overline{BC}$ be $D$ . Also, since $\angle{PQD}=60$ , let the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\overline{QD}$ be $E$ . Since $\triangle{QEP}$ is 30-60-90, and $PQ=1$ , $QE=\frac{1}{2}$ . Also, since $PR=2$ , $DE=2$ . Thus, $QD=\frac{5}{2}$ . Once again, since $\triangle{QBD}$ is 30-60-90, $QB=\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}$ . Similar reasoning to $\overline{AQ}$ and summing the segments yields $\boxed{(D) 4\sqrt{3}}$

## Solution 3 (Viviani's Theorem)
According to Viviani's Theorem, in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from a point inside the triangle will equal the altitude of the triangle. Thus, the height of the triangle is 6.
Then we start to form a 30-60-90 triangle. By that, we divide $6/\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}$ then multiply 2, and we get an answer of $\boxed{(D) 4\sqrt{3}}$
