# 2007 AMC 10B Problem 2

## Problem

Define the operation $\star$ by $a \star b = (a+b)b.$ What is $(3 \star 5) - (5 \star 3)?$

$\textbf{(A) } -16 \qquad\textbf{(B) } -8 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 0 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 8 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 16$

## Solution 1
Substitute and simplify. \[(3+5)5 - (5+3)3 = (3+5)2 = 8\cdot2 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }16}\]

## Solution 2
Note that $(a \star b) - (b \star a) = (a+b)b - (b+a)a= (a+b)(b-a)= b^2 - a^2$ . We can substitute $a=3$ and $b=5$ to get $5^2 - 3^2 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }16}$ .
