# 2020 AMC 10A Problem 9

## Problem

A single bench section at a school event can hold either $7$ adults or $11$ children. When $N$ bench sections are connected end to end, an equal number of adults and children seated together will occupy all the bench space. What is the least possible positive integer value of $N?$

$\textbf{(A) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 18 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 27 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 36 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 77$

## Solution 1
The least common multiple of $7$ and $11$ is $77$ . Therefore, there must be $77$ adults and $77$ children. The total number of benches is $\frac{77}{7}+\frac{77}{11}=11+7=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }18}$ .~taarunganesh

## Solution 2
Let $x$ denote how many adults there are. Since the number of adults is equal to the number of children we can write $N$ as $\frac{x}{7}+\frac{x}{11}=N$ . Simplifying we get $\frac{18x}{77} = N$ Since both $n$ and $x$ have to be positive integers, $x$ has to equal $77$ . Therefore, $N=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }18}$ is our final answer.

## Solution 3
We have 1 Bench = 7 Adults = 11 Children, or $A = \frac{11}{7}C$ .
The minimum number of benches is $N = x(A + C)$ .
This gives $\frac{77}{18}N = x$ , so that the minimum value for x is the integer 18, or (B).

## Solution 4 (Fast)
The ratio of adults and children is 7:11 and the total amount of benches is the amount of adult and children combined which gives 7 + 11 = $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }18}$ . We see that this is the smallest integer value.
