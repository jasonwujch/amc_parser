# 2020 AMC 10A Problem 2

## Problem

The numbers $3, 5, 7, a,$ and $b$ have an average (arithmetic mean) of $15$ . What is the average of $a$ and $b$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 0 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 15 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 30 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 45 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 60$

## Solution
The arithmetic mean of the numbers $3, 5, 7, a,$ and $b$ is equal to $\frac{3+5+7+a+b}{5}=\frac{15+a+b}{5}=15$ . Solving for $a+b$ , we get $a+b=60$ . Dividing by $2$ to find the average of the two numbers $a$ and $b$ gives $\frac{60}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }30}$ .

## Solution (two solutions - balancing and summing)
We know the average is 15. 3, 5, and 7 are, respectively, 12, 10, and 8 below the average. So far then we are -12 - 10 - 8 or 30 below the average. We have to make this up with a and b so on average each is 30/2 = 15 above the average. The average is 15 so each is on average 15+15 = 30, or answer C.
Incidentally we can immediately rule out answers A and B as being too small - with these we'd never catch up to get our average of 15. An alternative solution is that to get an average of 15 we need a sum of 15*5 = 75. We have 3, 5, and 7 which adds up to 15, so a and b must make up the remaining 75-15 = 60. 60/2 = 30 so the average of a and b is 30.
