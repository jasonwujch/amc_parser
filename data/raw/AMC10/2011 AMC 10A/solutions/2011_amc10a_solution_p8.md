## Problem

Last summer 30% of the birds living on Town Lake were geese, 25% were swans, 10% were herons, and 35% were ducks. What percent of the birds that were not swans were geese?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 40\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 50\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 60$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
75% of the total birds were not swans. Out of that 75%, there was $30\% / 75\% = \boxed{40\%\text{\textbf{ (C)}}}$ of the birds that were not swans that were geese.

## Solution 2
WLOG, suppose there were 100 birds in total living on Town Lake, then 30 were geese, 25 were swans, 10 were herons, and 35 were ducks. $100-25 = 75$ of the birds are not swans and 30 of these are geese, so the answer is $\frac{30}{75} \times 100 = \boxed{40 \%(C)}$ .
