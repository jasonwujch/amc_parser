## Problem

Which of the following equations does NOT have a solution?

$\text{(A)}\:(x+7)^2=0$

$\text{(B)}\:|-3x|+5=0$

$\text{(C)}\:\sqrt{-x}-2=0$

$\text{(D)}\:\sqrt{x}-8=0$

$\text{(E)}\:|-3x|-4=0$

## Solution 1
$|-3x|+5=0$ has no solution because absolute values only output nonnegative numbers.
Further: $(x+7)^2 = 0$ is true for $x = -7$
$\sqrt{-x}-2=0$ is true for $x = -4$
$\sqrt{x}-8=0$ is true for $x = 64$
$|-3x|-4=0$ is true for $x = \frac{4}{3}, -\frac{4}{3}$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}}$ .

## Solution 2
Instead of solving, we can just categorize and solve.
Section 1: This contains A,C,D as they are all squares or square roots. From skimming, we can get an answer as maybe C
Section 2: This contains B and E From skimming we can get we can get answer as maybe B
Now we can analyze and we see $-x$ can become $x$ if $x=-y$ and absolute value inequalities cannot be negative, so the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}}$
