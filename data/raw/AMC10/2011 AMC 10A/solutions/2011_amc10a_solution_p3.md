## Problem

Suppose [ $a$ $b$ ] denotes the average of $a$ and $b$ , and { $a$ $b$ $c$ } denotes the average of $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . What is $\{\{\text{1 1 0}\} \text{ [0 1] } 0\}?$

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{2}{9} \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{5}{18} \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{3} \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{7}{18} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{2}{3}$

## Solution
Average $1$ , $1$ , and $0$ to get $\frac23$ . Average $0$ , and $1$ , to get $\frac12$ . Average $\frac23$ , $\frac12$ , and $0$ . to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac7{18}}$
