## Problem

On a particular January day, the high temperature in Lincoln, Nebraska, was $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, and the average of the high and low temperatures was $3$ . In degrees, what was the low temperature in Lincoln that day?

$\textbf{(A)}\ -13 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ -8 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ -5 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ -3 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 11$

## Solution
Let $L$ be the low temperature. The high temperature is $L+16$ . The average is $\frac{L+(L+16)}{2}=3$ . Solving for $L$ , we get $L=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} \ -5}$
