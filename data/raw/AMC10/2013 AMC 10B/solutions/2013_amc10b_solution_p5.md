# 2013 AMC 10B Problem 5

## Problem

Positive integers $a$ and $b$ are each less than $6$ . What is the smallest possible value for $2 \cdot a - a \cdot b$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ -20\qquad\textbf{{(B)}}\ -15\qquad\textbf{{(C)}}\ -10\qquad\textbf{{(D)}}\ 0\qquad\textbf{{(E)}}\ 2$

## Solution 1
Factoring the equation gives $a(2 - b)$ . From this we can see that to obtain the least possible value, $2 - b$ should be negative, and should be as small as possible. To do so, $b$ should be maximized. Because $2 - b$ is negative, we should maximize the positive value of $a$ as well. The maximum values of both $a$ and $b$ are $5$ , so the answer is $5(2 - 5) = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -15}$ .
