# 2013 AMC 10B Problem 1

## Problem

What is $\frac{2+4+6}{1+3+5} - \frac{1+3+5}{2+4+6}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ -1 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{5}{36} \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{7}{12} \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{49}{20} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{43}{3}$

## Solution
This expression is equivalent to $\frac{12}{9} - \frac{9}{12} = \frac{16}{12} - \frac{9}{12} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{7}{12}}$
