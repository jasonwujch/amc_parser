# 2013 AMC 10B Problem 4

## Problem

When counting from $3$ to $201$ , $53$ is the $51^{\text{st}}$ number counted. When counting backwards from $201$ to $3$ , $53$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ number counted. What is $n$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 146 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 147 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 148 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 149 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 150$

## Solution
Note that $n$ is equal to the number of integers between $53$ and $201$ , inclusive. Thus, $n=201-53+1=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 149}$
