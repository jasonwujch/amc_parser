# 2013 AMC 10B Problem 20

## Problem

The number $2013$ is expressed in the form

where $a_1 \ge a_2 \ge \cdots \ge a_m$ and $b_1 \ge b_2 \ge \cdots \ge b_n$ are positive integers and $a_1 + b_1$ is as small as possible. What is $|a_1 - b_1|$ ?

## Solution
The prime factorization of $2013$ is $61\cdot11\cdot3$ . To have a factor of $61$ in the numerator and to minimize $a_1,$ $a_1$ must equal $61$ . Now we notice that there can be no prime $p$ which is not a factor of $2013$ such that $b_1<p<61,$ because this prime will not be canceled out in the denominator, and will lead to an extra factor in the numerator. The highest prime less than $61$ is $59$ , so there must be a factor of $59$ in the denominator. It follows that $b_1 = 59$ (to minimize $b_1$ as well), so the answer is $|61-59| = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }2}$ .
