# 2016 AMC 10A Problem 6

## Problem

Ximena lists the whole numbers $1$ through $30$ once. Emilio copies Ximena's numbers, replacing each occurrence of the digit $2$ by the digit $1$ . Ximena adds her numbers and Emilio adds his numbers. How much larger is Ximena's sum than Emilio's?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 13\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 26\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 102\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 103\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 110$

## Solution
For every tens digit 2, we subtract 10, and for every units digit 2, we subtract 1. Because 2 appears 10 times as a tens digit and 2 appears 3 times as a units digit, the answer is $10\cdot 10+1\cdot 3=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }103.}$
