## Problem

A triangle with vertices $A(0, 2)$ , $B(-3, 2)$ , and $C(-3, 0)$ is reflected about the $x$ -axis, then the image $\triangle A'B'C'$ is rotated counterclockwise about the origin by $90^{\circ}$ to produce $\triangle A''B''C''$ . Which of the following transformations will return $\triangle A''B''C''$ to $\triangle ABC$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}$ counterclockwise rotation about the origin by $90^{\circ}$ .

$\textbf{(B)}$ clockwise rotation about the origin by $90^{\circ}$ .

$\textbf{(C)}$ reflection about the $x$ -axis

$\textbf{(D)}$ reflection about the line $y = x$

$\textbf{(E)}$ reflection about the $y$ -axis.

## Solution
Consider a point $(x, y)$ . Reflecting it about the $x$ -axis will map it to $(x, -y)$ , and rotating it counterclockwise about the origin by $90^{\circ}$ will map it to $(y, x)$ . The operation that undoes this is a reflection about the $y = x$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$ .
