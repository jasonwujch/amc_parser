## Problem

For every dollar Ben spent on bagels, David spent $25$ cents less. Ben paid $\$12.50$ more than David. How much did they spend in the bagel store together?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \$37.50 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \$50.00\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \$87.50\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \$90.00\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \$92.50$

## Solution 1
If Ben paid $\$ 12.50$ more than David, then he paid $\frac{12.5}{.25}= \$ 50.00$ . Thus, David paid $\$ 37.50$ , and they spent $50.00+37.50 =\$ 87.50 \implies \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\$ 87.50}$ .

## Solution 2
If for every dollar Ben spent on bagels David spent $25$ cents less, then the ratio of the money that Ben spent to David spent is $4:3$ . We know that Ben paid $\$12.50$ more than David, so we can write $\$12.50\cdot (4+3)=\$ 87.50.$ Then the answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}.$
