## Problem

A rectangular box has integer side lengths in the ratio $1: 3: 4$ . Which of the following could be the volume of the box?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 48\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 56\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 64\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 96\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 144$

## Solution 1
Let the smallest side length be $x$ . Then the volume is $x \cdot 3x \cdot 4x =12x^3$ . If $x=2$ , then $12x^3 = 96 \implies \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 96.}$

## Solution 2
As seen in the first solution, we end up with $12x^3$ . Taking the answer choices and dividing by $12$ , we get $(A) 4$ , $(B) 4 \frac{2}{3}$ , $(C) 5 \frac{1}{3}$ , $(D) 8$ , $(E) 12$ and the final answer has to equal $x^3$ . The only answer choice that works is $(D)$ .

## Solution 3 (quick)
Clearly, the volume is a multiple of $3\cdot4=12$ . Since $12$ itself is not an option, the next possibility is $2\cdot6\cdot8=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~96}$ .
