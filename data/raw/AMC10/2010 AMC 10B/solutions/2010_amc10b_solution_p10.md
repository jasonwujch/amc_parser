## Problem

Shelby drives her scooter at a speed of $30$ miles per hour if it is not raining, and $20$ miles per hour if it is raining. Today she drove in the sun in the morning and in the rain in the evening, for a total of $16$ miles in $40$ minutes. How many minutes did she drive in the rain?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 18 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 21 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 24 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 27 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 30$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ be the time it is not raining, and $y$ be the time it is raining, in hours.
We have the system: $30x+20y=16$ and $x+y=\frac{2}{3}$
Solving gives $x=\frac{4}{15}$ and $y=\frac{2}{5}$
We want $y$ in minutes, $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 60=24 \Rightarrow C$

## Solution 2
Let $x$ be the time she drove in the rain. Thus, the number of minutes she did not drive in the rain is $40-x$ .
Since we are calculating the time in minutes, it is best to convert the speeds in minutes. Thus, the speed per minute when it is not raining is $\frac{1}{2}$ miles per minute, and $\frac{1}{3}$ miles per minute when it is raining. Thus, we have the equation, $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (40-x) + \frac{1}{3} \cdot x = 16$
Solving, gives $x$ = $24$ , so the amount of time she drove in the rain is $24$ minutes.
