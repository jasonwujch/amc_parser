## Problem

For a real number $x$ , define $\heartsuit(x)$ to be the average of $x$ and $x^2$ . What is $\heartsuit(1)+\heartsuit(2)+\heartsuit(3)$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 6 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 10 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 12 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 20$

## Solution
The average of two numbers, $a$ and $b$ , is defined as $\frac{a+b}{2}$ . Thus the average of $x$ and $x^2$ would be $\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$ . With that said, we need to find the sum when we plug, $1$ , $2$ and $3$ into that equation. So:
\[\frac{1(1+1)}{2} + \frac{2(2+1)}{2} + \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{6}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = 1+3+6= \boxed{\textbf{(C)} 10}\]
