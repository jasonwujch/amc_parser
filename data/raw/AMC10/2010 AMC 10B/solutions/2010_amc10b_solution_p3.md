# 2010 AMC 10B Problem 3

## Problem

A drawer contains red, green, blue, and white socks with at least 2 of each color. What is the minimum number of socks that must be pulled from the drawer to guarantee a matching pair?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 9$

## Solution
After you draw $4$ socks, you can have one of each color, so (according to the pigeonhole principle ), if you pull $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 5}$ then you will be guaranteed a matching pair.
