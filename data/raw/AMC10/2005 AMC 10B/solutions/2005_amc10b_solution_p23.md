# 2005 AMC 10B Problem 23

## Problem

In trapezoid $ABCD$ we have $\overline{AB}$ parallel to $\overline{DC}$ , $E$ as the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$ , and $F$ as the midpoint of $\overline{DA}$ . The area of $ABEF$ is twice the area of $FECD$ . What is $AB/DC$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 2 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 5 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 8$

## Solution 1
Since the heights of both trapezoids are equal, and the area of $ABEF$ is twice the area of $FECD$ ,
$\frac{AB+EF}{2}=2\left(\frac{DC+EF}{2}\right)$ .
$\frac{AB+EF}{2}=DC+EF$ , so
$AB+EF=2DC+2EF$ .
$EF$ is exactly halfway between $AB$ and $DC$ , so $EF=\frac{AB+DC}{2}$ .
$AB+\frac{AB+DC}{2}=2DC+AB+DC$ , so
$\frac{3}{2}AB+\frac{1}{2}DC=3DC+AB$ , and
$\frac{1}{2}AB=\frac{5}{2}DC$ .
$\frac{AB}{DC} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }5}$ .

## Solution 2
Mark $DC=z$ , $AB=x$ , and $FE=y.$ Note that the heights of trapezoids $ABEF$ & $FECD$ are the same. Mark the height to be $h$ .
Then, we have that $\tfrac{x+y}{2}\cdot h=2(\tfrac{y+z}{2} \cdot h)$ .
From this, we get that $x=2z+y$ .
We also get that $\tfrac{x+z}{2} \cdot 2h= 3(\tfrac{y+z}{2} \cdot h)$ .
Simplifying, we get that $2x=z+3y$
Notice that we want $\tfrac{AB}{DC}=\tfrac{x}{z}$ .
Dividing the first equation by $z$ , we get that $\tfrac{x}{z}=2+\tfrac{y}{z}\implies 3(\tfrac{x}{z})=6+3(\tfrac{y}{z})$ .
Dividing the second equation by $z$ , we get that $2(\tfrac{x}{z})=1+3(\tfrac{y}{z})$ .
Now, when we subtract the top equation from the bottom, we get that $\tfrac{x}{z}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }5}$

## Solution 3
Since the bases of the trapezoids along with the height are the same, the only thing that matters is the second base. Denote the length of the bigger trapezoid $x$ . The area of the smaller trapezoid is $A$ = $h \cdot \frac {b_1 + b_2}{2}$ . The area of the larger trapezoid is $A$ = $h \cdot \frac {b_1 + x}{2}$ . Since this problem asks for proportions, assume that $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 2$ .
The smaller trapezoid has area $h$ while the larger trapezoid must have area $5h$ . We have the equation $\frac {x}{2} = 5$ . $x$ = 10, and our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }5}$

## Solution 4 (SIMPLE)
By setting the area of $ABEF$ equal to $2$ times the area of $DCEF$ , you get that $AB + FE = 2(DC + FE)$ . Thus, $AB = 2DC + FE$ . Note that $FE = DC + \frac{AB-DC}{2}$ . From this, we get $AB = 2DC + DC + AB/2 - DC/2$ . Simplifying, $AB/DC$ equals $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }5}$
