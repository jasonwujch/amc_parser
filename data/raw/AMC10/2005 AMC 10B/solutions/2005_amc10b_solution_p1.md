## Problem

A scout troop buys $1000$ candy bars at a price of five for $2$ dollars. They sell all the candy bars at the price of two for $1$ dollar. What was their profit, in dollars?

$\textbf{(A) }\ 100 \qquad \textbf{(B) }\ 200 \qquad \textbf{(C) }\ 300 \qquad \textbf{(D) }\ 400 \qquad \textbf{(E) }\ 500$

## Solution
\begin{align*} \mbox{Expenses} &= 1000 \cdot \frac25 = 400 \\ \mbox{Revenue} &= 1000 \cdot \frac12 = 500 \\ \mbox{Profit} &= \mbox{Revenue} - \mbox{Expenses} = 500-400 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }100}. \end{align*} Note: Revenue is a gain.

## Solution 2 (Faster)
Note that the troop buys $10$ candy bars at a price of $4$ dollars and sells $10$ bars at a price of $5$ dollars. So the troop gains $1$ dollar for every $10$ bars. So therefore we divide $1000 \div 10 = 100$ . So our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }100}$ . ~HyperVoid
