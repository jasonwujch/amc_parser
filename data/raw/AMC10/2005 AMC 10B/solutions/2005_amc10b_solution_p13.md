# 2005 AMC 10B Problem 13

## Problem

How many numbers between $1$ and $2005$ are integer multiples of $3$ or $4$ but not $12$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 501 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 668 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 835 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 1002 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 1169$

## Solution 1
To find the multiples of $3$ or $4$ but not $12$ , you need to find the number of multiples of $3$ and $4$ , and then subtract twice the number of multiples of $12$ , because you overcount and do not want to include them. The multiples of $3$ are $\frac{2005}{3} = 668\text{ }R1.$ The multiples of $4$ are $\frac{2005}{4} = 501 \text{ }R1$ . The multiples of $12$ are $\frac{2005}{12} = 167\text{ }R1.$ So, the answer is $668+501-167-167 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 835}$

## Solution 2
From $1$ - $12$ , the multiples of $3$ or $4$ but not $12$ are $3, 4, 6, 8,$ and $9$ , a total of five numbers. Since $\frac{5}{12}$ of positive integers are multiples of $3$ or $4$ but not $12$ from $1$ - $12$ , the answer is approximately $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 2005$ = $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }835}$

## Solution 3
For every multiple of 12, there are a total of 7 multiples of 3 and 4 combined. However, we do not want to include the 2 multiples of 12, so we subtract 2 from 7, leaving us with 5.
We divide 2005 by 12 to determine how many such multiples exist: \[\left\lfloor \frac{2005}{12} \right\rfloor = 167\]
Multiplying that by 5, we get: \[167 \times 5 = 835\]
So our answer is: \[\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 835}\]
