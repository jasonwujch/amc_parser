# 2003 AMC 10B Problem 10

## Problem

Nebraska, the home of the AMC, changed its license plate scheme. Each old license plate consisted of a letter followed by four digits. Each new license plate consists of three letters followed by three digits. By how many times has the number of possible license plates increased?

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{26}{10} \qquad\textbf{(B) } \frac{26^2}{10^2} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \frac{26^2}{10} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \frac{26^3}{10^3} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \frac{26^3}{10^2}$

## Solution
There are $26$ letters and $10$ digits. There were $26 \cdot 10^4$ old license plates. There are $26^3 \cdot 10^3$ new license plates. The number of license plates increased by
\[\frac{26^3 \cdot 10^3}{26 \cdot 10^4} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) \ } \frac{26^2}{10}}\]
Note: Nebraska is not actually the home of the AMC, the AMC resides in Washington D.C., where its headquarters is located.
