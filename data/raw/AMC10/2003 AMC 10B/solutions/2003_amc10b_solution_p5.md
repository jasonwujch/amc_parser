# 2003 AMC 10B Problem 5

## Problem

Moe uses a mower to cut his rectangular $90$ -foot by $150$ -foot lawn. The swath he cuts is $28$ inches wide, but he overlaps each cut by $4$ inches to make sure that no grass is missed. He walks at the rate of $5000$ feet per hour while pushing the mower. Which of the following is closest to the number of hours it will take Moe to mow the lawn?

$\textbf{(A) } 0.75 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 0.8 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 1.35 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 1.5 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 3$

## Solution
Since the swath Moe actually mows is $24$ inches, or $2$ feet wide, he mows $10000$ square feet in one hour. His lawn has an area of $13500$ , so it will take Moe $1.35$ hours to finish mowing the lawn. Thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 1.35}$ .

## Solution 2 (very easy to understand)
Let's assume that the swath moves back and forth; parallel to the $90$ feet side. Thus, the length of one strip is $90$ feet. Now we need to find out how many strips there are. In reality, the swath Moe mows is $24$ inches wide, which can be easily translated into $2$ feet. $\frac{150}{2}$ is the number of strips Moe needs to mow, which is equal to $75$ . Therefore, the total number of feet Moe mows is $75\times90$ . Since Moe's mowing rate is $5000$ feet per hour, $\frac{75\times90}{5000}$ is the number of hours it takes him to do his job. Using basic calculations, we compute the answer. $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 1.35}$ .
