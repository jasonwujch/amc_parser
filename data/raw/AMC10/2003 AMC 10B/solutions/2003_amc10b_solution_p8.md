## Problem

The second and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are $2$ and $6$ . Which of the following is a possible first term?

$\textbf{(A) } -\sqrt{3} \qquad\textbf{(B) } -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \qquad\textbf{(C) } -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \sqrt{3} \qquad\textbf{(E) } 3$

## Solution
Let the first term be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$ . Therefore,
\[ar=2\ \ (1) \qquad \text{and} \qquad ar^3=6\ \ (2)\]
Dividing $(2)$ by $(1)$ eliminates the $a$ , yielding $r^2=3$ , so $r=\pm\sqrt{3}$ .
Now, since $ar=2$ , $a=\frac{2}{r}$ , so $a=\frac{2}{\pm\sqrt{3}}=\pm\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$ .
We therefore see that $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}}$ is a possible first term.
