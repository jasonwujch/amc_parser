# 2003 AMC 10B Problem 13

## Problem

Let $\clubsuit(x)$ denote the sum of the digits of the positive integer $x$ . For example, $\clubsuit(8)=8$ and $\clubsuit(123)=1+2+3=6$ . For how many two-digit values of $x$ is $\clubsuit(\clubsuit(x))=3$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 3 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 6 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 9 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 10$

## Solution
Let $y=\clubsuit (x)$ . Since $x \leq 99$ , we have $y \leq 18$ . Thus if $\clubsuit (y)=3$ , then $y=3$ or $y=12$ . The 3 values of $x$ for which $\clubsuit (x)=3$ are 12, 21, and 30, and the 7 values of $x$ for which $\clubsuit (x)=12$ are 39, 48, 57, 66, 75, 84, and 93. There are $\boxed{E}$ = $\boxed{10}$ values in all.
