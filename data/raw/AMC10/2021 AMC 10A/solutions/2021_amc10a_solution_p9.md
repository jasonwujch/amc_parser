# 2021 AMC 10A Problem 9

## Problem

What is the least possible value of $(xy-1)^2+(x+y)^2$ for real numbers $x$ and $y$ ?

$\textbf{(A)} ~0\qquad\textbf{(B)} ~\frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(C)} ~\frac{1}{2} \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~1 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~2$

## Solution 1 (Expand)
Expanding, we get that the expression is $x^2+2xy+y^2+x^2y^2-2xy+1$ or $x^2+y^2+x^2y^2+1$ . By the Trivial Inequality (all squares are nonnegative) the minimum value for this is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~1}$ , which can be achieved at $x=y=0$ .

## Solution 2 (Expand and then Factor)
We expand the original expression, then factor the result by grouping: \begin{align*} (xy-1)^2+(x+y)^2&=\left(x^2y^2-2xy+1\right)+\left(x^2+2xy+y^2\right) \\ &=x^2y^2+x^2+y^2+1 \\ &=x^2\left(y^2+1\right)+\left(y^2+1\right) \\ &=\left(x^2+1\right)\left(y^2+1\right). \end{align*} Clearly, both factors are positive. By the Trivial Inequality, we have \[\left(x^2+1\right)\left(y^2+1\right)\geq\left(0+1\right)\left(0+1\right)=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~1}.\] Note that the least possible value of $(xy-1)^2+(x+y)^2$ occurs at $x=y=0.$

## Solution 3 (Beyond Overkill)
Like solution 1, expand and simplify the original equation to $x^2+y^2+x^2y^2+1$ and let $f(x, y) = x^2+y^2+x^2y^2+1$ . To find local extrema, find where $\nabla f(x, y) = \boldsymbol{0}$ . First, find the first partial derivative with respect to x and y and find where they are $0$ : \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x + 2xy^{2} = 2x(1 + y^{2}) = 0 \implies x = 0\] \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y + 2yx^{2} = 2y(1 + x^{2}) = 0 \implies y = 0\] Thus, there is a local extremum at $(0, 0)$ . Because this is the only extremum, we can assume that this is a minimum because the problem asks for the minimum (though this can also be proven using the partial second derivative test) and the global minimum since it's the only minimum, meaning $f(0, 0)$ is the minimum of $f(x, y)$ . Plugging $(0, 0)$ into $f(x, y)$ , we find 1 $\implies \boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~1}$ .

Remark: Honestly, this isn't even that overkill. I did it this way, and it was not very bashy. ~vaishnav
