## Problem

All the roots of the polynomial $z^6-10z^5+Az^4+Bz^3+Cz^2+Dz+16$ are positive integers, possibly repeated. What is the value of $B$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }{-}88 \qquad \textbf{(B) }{-}80 \qquad \textbf{(C) }{-}64 \qquad \textbf{(D) }{-}41\qquad \textbf{(E) }{-}40$

## Solution 1
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the six roots is $10$ and the product of the six roots is $16$ . By inspection, we see the roots are $1, 1, 2, 2, 2,$ and $2$ , so the function is $(z-1)^2(z-2)^4=(z^2-2z+1)(z^4-8z^3+24z^2-32z+16)$ . Therefore, calculating just the $z^3$ terms, we get $B = -32 - 48 - 8 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }{-}88}$ .

## Solution 2
Using the same method as Solution 1, we find that the roots are $2, 2, 2, 2, 1,$ and $1$ . Note that $B$ is the negation of the 3rd symmetric sum of the roots. Using casework on the number of 1's in each of the $\binom {6}{3} = 20$ products $r_a \cdot r_b \cdot r_c,$ we obtain \[B= - \left(\binom {4}{3} \binom {2}{0} \cdot 2^{3} + \binom {4}{2} \binom{2}{1} \cdot 2^{2} \cdot 1 + \binom {4}{1} \binom {2}{2} \cdot 2 \right) = -\left(32+48+8 \right) = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }{-}88}.\] ~ike.chen

## Solution 3 (brute force)
Same as solution 1, we find the roots are $1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2$ by Vieta's formula. This next part is brute force expansion. $-B=\\r_1r_2r_3+r_1r_2r_4+r_1r_2r_5+r_1r_2r_6+\\r_1r_3r_4+r_1r_3r_5+r_1r_3r_6+\\r_1r_4r_5+r_1r_4r_6+\\r_1r_5r_6+\\r_2r_3r_4+r_2r_3r_5+r_2r_3r_6+\\r_2r_4r_5+r_2r_4r_6+\\r_2r_5r_6+\\r_3r_4r_5+r_3r_4r_6+\\r_3r_5r_6+\\r_4r_5r_6\\=2 \times 4 + 4 \times 12 + 8 \times 4\\ =8 + 48 + 32\\B = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }{-}88}$
