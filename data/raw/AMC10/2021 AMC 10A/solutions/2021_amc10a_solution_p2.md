# 2021 AMC 10A Problem 2

## Problem

Portia's high school has $3$ times as many students as Lara's high school. The two high schools have a total of $2600$ students. How many students does Portia's high school have?

$\textbf{(A)} ~600 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~650 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~1950 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~2000\qquad\textbf{(E)} ~2050$

## Solution 1 (Two Variables)
The following system of equations can be formed with $P$ representing the number of students in Portia's high school and $L$ representing the number of students in Lara's high school: \begin{align*} P&=3L, \\ P+L&=2600. \end{align*} Substituting $P=3L$ gives $4L=2600.$ Solving for $L$ gives $L=650.$ Since we need to find $P,$ we multiply $650$ by $3$ to get $P=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~1950}.$

## Solution 2 (One Variable)
Suppose Lara's high school has $x$ students, so Portia's high school has $3x$ students. We have $x+3x=2600,$ or $4x=2600.$ The answer is \[3x=2600\cdot\frac 34=650\cdot3=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~1950}.\]

## Solution 3 (Arithmetic)
Clearly, $2600$ is $4$ times the number of students in Lara's high school. Therefore, Lara's high school has $2600\div4=650$ students, and Portia's high school has $650\cdot3=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~1950}$ students.

## Solution 4 (Observations)
The number of students in Portia's high school must be a multiple of $3.$ This eliminates $\textbf{(B)},\textbf{(D)},$ and $\textbf{(E)}.$ Since $\textbf{(A)}$ is too small (as it is clear that $600+\frac{600}{3}<2600$ ), we are left with $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~1950}.$
