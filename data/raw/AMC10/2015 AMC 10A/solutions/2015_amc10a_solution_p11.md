## Problem

The ratio of the length to the width of a rectangle is $4$ : $3$ . If the rectangle has diagonal of length $d$ , then the area may be expressed as $kd^2$ for some constant $k$ . What is $k$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{2}{7}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{3}{7}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{12}{25}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{16}{25}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{3}{4}$

## Solution
Let the rectangle have length $4x$ and width $3x$ . Then by $3-4-5$ triangles (or the Pythagorean Theorem), we have $d = 5x$ , and so $x = \dfrac{d}{5}$ . Hence, the area of the rectangle is $3x \cdot 4x = 12x^2 = \dfrac{12d^2}{25}$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\;\frac{12}{25}}$
