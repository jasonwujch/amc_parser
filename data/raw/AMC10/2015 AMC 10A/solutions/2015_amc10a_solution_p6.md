## Problem

The sum of two positive numbers is $5$ times their difference. What is the ratio of the larger number to the smaller number?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{5}{4}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{3}{2}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{9}{5}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 2 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{5}{2}$

## Solution 1
Let $a$ be the bigger number and $b$ be the smaller.
$a + b = 5(a - b)$ .
Multiplying out gives $a + b = 5a - 5b$ and rearranging gives $4a = 6b$ and factorised into $2a = 3b$ and then solving gives
$\frac{a}{b} = \frac32$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac32}$ .

## Solution 2
Without loss of generality, let the two numbers be $3$ and $2$ , as they clearly satisfy the condition of the problem. The ratio of the larger to the smaller is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac32}$ .
