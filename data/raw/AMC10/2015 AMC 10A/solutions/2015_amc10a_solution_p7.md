## Problem

How many terms are in the arithmetic sequence $13$ , $16$ , $19$ , $\dotsc$ , $70$ , $73$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 20 \qquad\textbf{(B)} \ 21 \qquad\textbf{(C)} \ 24 \qquad\textbf{(D)} \ 60 \qquad\textbf{(E)} \ 61$

## Solution 1
$73-13 = 60$ , so the amount of terms in the sequence $13$ , $16$ , $19$ , $\dotsc$ , $70$ , $73$ is the same as in the sequence $0$ , $3$ , $6$ , $\dotsc$ , $57$ , $60$ .
In this sequence, the terms are the multiples of $3$ going up to $60$ , and there are $20$ multiples of $3$ in $60$ .
However, the number 0 must also be included, adding another multiple. So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 21}$ .

## Solution 2
Using the formula for arithmetic sequence's nth term, we see that $a + (n-1)d \Longrightarrow13 + (n-1)3 =73, \Longrightarrow n = 21$ $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 21}$ .

## Solution 3
Minus each of the terms by $12$ to make the the sequence $1 , 4 , 7,..., 61$ . $\frac{61-1}{3}=20, 20 + 1 = 21$
$\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 21}$ .

## Solution 4
Subtract each of the terms by $10$ to make the sequence $3 , 6 , 9,..., 60, 63$ . Then divide the each term in the sequence by $3$ to get $1, 2, 3,..., 20, 21$ . Now it is clear to see that there are $21$ terms in the sequence. $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 21}$ .
