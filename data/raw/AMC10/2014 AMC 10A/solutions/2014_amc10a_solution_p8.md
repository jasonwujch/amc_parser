# 2014 AMC 10A Problem 8

## Problem

Which of the following numbers is a perfect square?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \dfrac{14!15!}2\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \dfrac{15!16!}2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \dfrac{16!17!}2\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \dfrac{17!18!}2\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \dfrac{18!19!}2$

## Solution 1
Note that for all positive $n$ , we have \[\dfrac{n!(n+1)!}{2}\] \[\implies\dfrac{(n!)^2\cdot(n+1)}{2}\] \[\implies (n!)^2\cdot\dfrac{n+1}{2}\]
We must find a value of $n$ such that $(n!)^2\cdot\dfrac{n+1}{2}$ is a perfect square. Since $(n!)^2$ is a perfect square, we must also have $\frac{n+1}{2}$ be a perfect square.
In order for $\frac{n+1}{2}$ to be a perfect square, $n+1$ must be twice a perfect square. From the answer choices, $n+1=18$ works, thus, $n=17$ and our desired answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{17!18!}{2}}$

## Solution 2 (Variation of Solution 1)
We take the first option A. \( \frac{14! \cdot 15!}{2} \). This is just equal to \( 14!^2 \cdot \frac{15}{2} \). \( \frac{15}{2} \) is 7.5, and 7.5 is not a perfect square, therefore option A is incorrect.
We can also rule that \( \frac{17}{2} = 8.5 \) and \( \frac{19}{2} = 9.5 \) are both not perfect squares, so option choices C and E are also incorrect.
If we take B. \( \frac{15! \cdot 16!}{2} \), we see that \( 15!^2 \) is a perfect square, but \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) is not, so B is incorrect. Our remaining option is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{17!18!}{2}}$ .
Proof:
\[\frac{17! \cdot 18!}{2} \Rightarrow 17!^2 \cdot \frac{18}{2} \Rightarrow 17!^2 \cdot 9 \Rightarrow 17!^2 \cdot 3^2.\]
The product of two squares is always a perfect square.
