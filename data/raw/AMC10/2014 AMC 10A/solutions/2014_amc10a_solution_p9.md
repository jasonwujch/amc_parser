## Problem

The two legs of a right triangle, which are altitudes, have lengths $2\sqrt3$ and $6$ . How long is the third altitude of the triangle?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution 1
We find that the area of the triangle is $\frac{6\times 2\sqrt{3}}{2} =6\sqrt{3}$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem , we have that the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2+6^2}=4\sqrt{3}$ . Dropping an altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse, we can calculate the area in another way.
Let $h$ be the third height of the triangle. We have $\frac{4\sqrt{3}h}{2}=6\sqrt{3}\implies h = \frac{6 \cdot 2}{4} \implies h=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3}$
Note: The third altitude of a right triangle is always the product of the lengths of the two legs divided by the hypotenuse.

## Solution 2
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have that the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2+6^2}=4\sqrt{3}$ . Notice that we now have a 30-60-90 triangle, with the angle between sides $2\sqrt{3}$ and $4\sqrt{3}$ equal to $60^{\circ}$ . Dropping an altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse, we see that our desired height is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3}$ (We can also check from the other side).

## Solution 3 (Simple)
From solution 1, we know the 3rd altitude of a right triangle is the product of the 2 legs that are not the hypotenuse, divided by the length of the hypotenuse. The product of the 2 legs of this triangle is $12\sqrt{3}$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem , the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2+6^2}=4\sqrt{3}$ . The length of the third altitude is $\frac{12\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{3}}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3}$ ~ shunyipanda
