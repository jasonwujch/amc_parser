# 2014 AMC 10A Problem 21

## Problem

Positive integers $a$ and $b$ are such that the graphs of $y=ax+5$ and $y=3x+b$ intersect the $x$ -axis at the same point. What is the sum of all possible $x$ -coordinates of these points of intersection?

$\textbf{(A)}\ {-20}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ {-18}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ {-15}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ {-12}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ {-8}$

## Solution 1
Note that when $y=0$ , the $x$ values of the equations should be equal by the problem statement. We have that \[0 = ax + 5 \implies x = -\dfrac{5}{a}\] \[0 = 3x+b \implies x= -\dfrac{b}{3}\] Which means that \[-\dfrac{5}{a} = -\dfrac{b}{3} \implies ab = 15\] The only possible pairs $(a,b)$ then are $(a,b) = (1,15), (3,5), (5,3), (15, 1)$ . These pairs give respective $x$ -values of $-5, -\dfrac{5}{3}, -1, -\dfrac{1}{3}$ which have a sum of $\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \: -8}$ .

## Solution 2
Using part of what we got from Solution 1, notice that the value of $x$ cannot be less than $-5$ . We also know for the first equation that the values of $x$ have to be $5$ divided by something. Also, for the second equation, the values of $x$ can only be $-\frac13,-\frac23,-\frac33, \dots$ . Therefore, we see that, the only values common between the two sequences are $-1, -5, -\frac13,-\frac53$ , and adding them up, we get for our answer, $\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \: -8}$ .
