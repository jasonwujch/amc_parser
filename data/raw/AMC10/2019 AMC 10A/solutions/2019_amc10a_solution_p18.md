## Problem

For some positive integer $k$ , the repeating base- $k$ representation of the (base-ten) fraction $\frac{7}{51}$ is $0.\overline{23}_k = 0.232323..._k$ . What is $k$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 13 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 14 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 15 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 16 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 17$

## Solution 1
We can expand the fraction $0.\overline{23}_k$ as follows: $0.\overline{23}_k = 2\cdot k^{-1} + 3 \cdot k^{-2} + 2 \cdot k^{-3} + 3 \cdot k^{-4} + \cdots$
Notice that this is equivalent to \[2( k^{-1} + k^{-3} + k^{-5} + ... ) + 3 (k^{-2} + k^{-4} + k^{-6} + \cdots )\]
By summing the geometric series and simplifying, we have $\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1} = \frac{7}{51}$ . Solving this quadratic equation (or simply testing the answer choices) yields the answer $k = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ .

## Solution 2
Let $a = 0.2323\dots_k$ . Therefore, $k^2a=23.2323\dots_k$ .
From this, we see that $k^2a-a=23_k$ , so $a = \frac{23_k}{k^2-1} = \frac{2k+3}{k^2-1} = \frac{7}{51}$ .
Now, similar to in Solution 1, we can either test if $2k+3$ is a multiple of $7$ with the answer choices, or actually solve the quadratic, so that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ .

## Solution 3
Just as in Solution 1, we arrive at the equation $\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1}=\frac{7}{51}$ .
Therefore now, we can rewrite this as $\frac{2k+3}{(k-1)(k+1)}=\frac{7}{51}=\frac{7}{3\cdot 17}$ . Notice that $2k+3=2(k+1)+1=2(k-1)+5$ . As $17$ is a prime number, we therefore must have that one of $k-1$ and $k+1$ is divisible by $17$ . Now, checking each of the answer choices, this will lead us to the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ .

## Solution 4
Assuming you are familiar with the rules for basic repeating decimals, $0.232323... = \frac{23}{99}$ . Now we want our base, $k$ , to conform to $23\equiv7\pmod k$ and $99\equiv51\pmod k$ , the reason being that we wish to convert the number from base $10$ to base $k$ . Given the first equation, we know that $k$ must equal 9, 16, 23, or generally, $7n+2$ . The only number in this set that is one of the multiple choices is $16$ . When we test this on the second equation, $99\equiv51\pmod k$ , it comes to be true. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ .

## Solution 5
Note that the LHS equals \[\bigg(\frac{2}{k} + \frac{2}{k^3} + \cdots \bigg) + \bigg(\frac{3}{k^2} + \frac{3}{k^4} + \cdots \bigg) = \frac{\frac{2}{k}}{1 - \frac{1}{k^2}} + \frac{\frac{3}{k^2}}{1 - \frac{1}{k^2}} = \frac{2k+3}{k^2-1},\] from which we see our equation becomes \[\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1} = \frac{7}{51}, \ \ \implies \ \ 51(2k+3) = 7(k^2-1).\]
Note that $17$ therefore divides $k^2 - 1,$ but as $17$ is prime this therefore implies \[k \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{17}.\] (Warning: This would not be necessarily true if $17$ were composite.) Note that $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} 16 }$ is the only answer choice congruent satisfying this modular congruence, thus completing the problem. $\square$

==Solution 6==(Cheese and answer choices)
We can find that we just estimate the first two digits and can get $\frac{2}{k} + \frac{2}{k^2} = \frac{7}{51}$ and plug in some values and expand into $\frac{2k+2}{k^2} = \frac{7}{51}$ and plugin some values and find that for 16, $\frac{34}{256}$ is very close to our target of $\frac{7}{51}$ so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ .

## Solution 6 (Risky)
The fraction \( 23/99 = 0.23232323... \)
We have the base representation of \( 7/51 \).
There exists some fraction \( a/b \) such that \( 7/51 \cdot a/b = 23/99 \).
\( a = 23/7 \), \( b = 99/51 \). Our fraction is then \( a/b = (23/7) / (99/51) \Rightarrow (23 \times 51) / (7 \times 99) \Rightarrow 1173/693 \).
Bases must be a multiple of the square of a number. We see that \( \sqrt{1173} \) is about 34 and \( \sqrt{693} \) is about 26. We subtract to get a common square, which is \( 34-26 = 8 \).
Our answer must be a multiple of 8, and the only one is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ .

## Solution 7 (Also Risky)
Notice how \( 23/99 = 0.232323232323\ldots \), but round it down to \( 0.23 \). \( 7/51 \) is around \( 0.13 \). We then have \( 0.23 - 0.13 = 0.1 \).
Multiply by 1000 to get \( 0.1 \times 1000 = 100 \).
The fraction is the base \( k \) number multiplied by another number divided by 100. The number that gets closest to the number 100 when multiplied by another number is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ .
