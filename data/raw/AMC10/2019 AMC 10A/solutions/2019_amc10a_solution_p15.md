## Problem

A sequence of numbers is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1$ , $a_2 = \frac{3}{7}$ , and \[a_n=\frac{a_{n-2} \cdot a_{n-1}}{2a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}}\] for all $n \geq 3$ Then $a_{2019}$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$ , where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $p+q ?$

$\textbf{(A) } 2020 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 4039 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 6057 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 6061 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 8078$

## Solution 1 (Induction)
Using the recursive formula, we find $a_3=\frac{3}{11}$ , $a_4=\frac{3}{15}$ , and so on. It appears that $a_n=\frac{3}{4n-1}$ , for all $n$ . Setting $n=2019$ , we find $a_{2019}=\frac{3}{8075}$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }8078}$ .
To prove this formula, we use induction. We are given that $a_1=1$ and $a_2=\frac{3}{7}$ , which satisfy our formula. Now assume the formula holds true for all $n\le m$ for some positive integer $m$ . By our assumption, $a_{m-1}=\frac{3}{4m-5}$ and $a_m=\frac{3}{4m-1}$ . Using the recursive formula, \[a_{m+1}=\frac{a_{m-1}\cdot a_m}{2a_{m-1}-a_m}=\frac{\frac{3}{4m-5}\cdot\frac{3}{4m-1}}{2\cdot\frac{3}{4m-5}-\frac{3}{4m-1}}=\frac{\left(\frac{3}{4m-5}\cdot\frac{3}{4m-1}\right)(4m-5)(4m-1)}{\left(2\cdot\frac{3}{4m-5}-\frac{3}{4m-1}\right)(4m-5)(4m-1)}=\frac{9}{6(4m-1)-3(4m-5)}=\frac{3}{4(m+1)-1},\] so our induction is complete.

## Solution 2
We have $\frac{1}{a_n} = \frac{2a_{n-2}-a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2} \cdot a_{n-1}}=\frac{2}{a_{n-1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}$ , in other words, $\frac{1}{a_n}-\frac{1}{a_{n-1}} = \frac{1}{a_{n-1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}$ . So $\{\frac{1}{a_n}\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with step size $\frac{7}{3}-1=\frac{4}{3}$ , which means $\frac{1}{a_{2019}} = 1+2018 \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8075}{3}$ . Since the numerator and the denominator are relatively prime, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 8078}$ .

## Solution 3
It seems reasonable to transform the equation into something else. Let $a_{n}=x$ , $a_{n-1}=y$ , and $a_{n-2}=z$ . Therefore, we have \[x=\frac{zy}{2z-y}\] \[2xz-xy=zy\] \[2xz=y(x+z)\] \[y=\frac{2xz}{x+z}\] Thus, $y$ is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $z$ . This implies $a_{n}$ is a harmonic sequence or equivalently $b_{n}=\frac{1}{a_{n}}$ is arithmetic. Now, we have $b_{1}=1$ , $b_{2}=\frac{7}{3}$ , $b_{3}=\frac{11}{3}$ , and so on. Since the common difference is $\frac{4}{3}$ , we can express $b_{n}$ explicitly as $b_{n}=\frac{4}{3}(n-1)+1$ . This gives $b_{2019}=\frac{4}{3}(2019-1)+1=\frac{8075}{3}$ which implies $a_{2019}=\frac{3}{8075}=\frac{p}{q}$ . $p+q=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 8078}$ ~jakeg314

## Solution 4 (Arithmetic Sequence)
Notice that \[a_n = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{a_{n-1}} - \frac{1}{a_{n-2}}}.\] Therefore, \[\frac{1}{a_n} = \frac{2}{a_{n-1}} - \frac{1}{a_{n-2}}, \ \ \implies \ \ \frac{\frac{1}{a_n} + \frac{1}{a_{n-2}}}{2} = \frac{1}{a_{n-1}}.\] Therefore, the sequence $b_n = \frac{1}{a_n}$ is an arithmetic sequence. Notice that the common difference of $b$ is $\frac{4}{3},$ and therefore \[b_{2019} = b_1 + 2018 \bigg(\frac{4}{3}\bigg) = 1 + 2018 \bigg(\frac{4}{3} \bigg) = \frac{8075}{3}.\] Therefore, we see that $a_{2019} = \frac{3}{8075},$ so that $p + q = \boxed{\text{(E) } 8078}.$

Note: This is similar to solutions #2 and #3, although you can notice that in #2's case the new sequence $B$ actually forms an arithmetic sequence.

## Solution 5 (Characteristic Equation - Overkill but Generic)
We have $\frac{1}{a_n} = \frac{2a_{n-2}-a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2} \cdot a_{n-1}}=\frac{2}{a_{n-1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}$ ,
let $b_n = \frac{1}{a_n}$ , then $b_n = 2b_{n-1} - b_{n-2}$
, this is 2nd order linear homogeneous recurrence sequence,
the characteristic equation for this is $x^2 -2x +1 = 0$ , which has double root x=1
so $b_n = (c_1 + c_2 \cdot n) \cdot 1^n$
plug in $b_1 = \frac{1}{a_1} = 1 = c_1 + c_2 \cdot 1, b_2 = \frac{1}{a_2}= \frac{7}{3} =c_1 + c_2 \cdot 2$
we solve $c_1 = -\frac{1}{3} , c_2=\frac{4}{3}$ , so $b_n = -\frac{1}{3} + \frac{4}{3} \cdot n$
so ${b_{2019}} = -\frac{1}{3} + \frac{4}{3} \cdot 2019 = \frac{8075}{3}$ .
$a_{2019} = \frac{1}{b_{2019}} = \frac{3}{8075}$
Since the numerator and the denominator are relatively prime, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 8078}$ .
- note: characteristic equation is overkill for this simple one but is more generic solution for other parameter values.
