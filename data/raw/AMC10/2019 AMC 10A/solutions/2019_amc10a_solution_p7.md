## Problem

Two lines with slopes $\dfrac{1}{2}$ and $2$ intersect at $(2,2)$ . What is the area of the triangle enclosed by these two lines and the line $x+y=10 ?$

$\textbf{(A) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 4\sqrt{2} \qquad\textbf{(C) } 6 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 8 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 6\sqrt{2}$

## Solution 1
Let's first work out the slope-intercept form of all three lines: $(x,y)=(2,2)$ and $y=\frac{x}{2} + b$ implies $2=\frac{2}{2} +b=> 2=1+b$ so $b=1$ , while $y=2x + c$ implies $2= 2 \cdot 2+c=> 2=4+c$ so $c=-2$ . Also, $x+y=10$ implies $y=-x+10$ . Thus the lines are $y=\frac{x}{2} +1, y=2x-2,$ and $y=-x+10$ . Now we find the intersection points between each of the lines with $y=-x+10$ , which are $(6,4)$ and $(4,6)$ . Using the distance formula and then the Pythagorean Theorem, we see that we have an isosceles triangle with base $2\sqrt{2}$ and height $3\sqrt{2}$ , whose area is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .

## Solution 3
Like in the other solutions, solve the systems of equations to see that the triangle's two other vertices are at $(4, 6)$ and $(6, 4)$ . Then apply Heron's Formula: the semi-perimeter will be $s = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{20}$ , so the area reduces nicely to a difference of squares, making it $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .

## Solution 4
Like in the other solutions, we find, either using algebra or simply by drawing the lines on squared paper, that the three points of intersection are $(2, 2)$ , $(4, 6)$ , and $(6, 4)$ . We can now draw the bounding square with vertices $(2, 2)$ , $(2, 6)$ , $(6, 6)$ and $(6, 2)$ , and deduce that the triangle's area is $16-4-2-4=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .

## Solution 5
Like in other solutions, we find that the three points of intersection are $(2, 2)$ , $(4, 6)$ , and $(6, 4)$ . Using graph paper, we can see that this triangle has $6$ boundary lattice points and $4$ interior lattice points. By Pick's Theorem, the area is $\frac62 + 4 - 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .

## Solution 6
Like in other solutions, we find the three points of intersection. Label these $A (2, 2)$ , $B (4, 6)$ , and $C (6, 4)$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB = AC = 2\sqrt5$ and $BC = 2\sqrt2$ . By the Law of Cosines, \[\cos A = \frac{(2\sqrt5)^2 + (2\sqrt5)^2 - (2\sqrt2)^2}{2 \cdot 2\sqrt5 \cdot 2\sqrt5} = \frac{20 + 20 - 8}{40} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac45\] Therefore, $\sin A = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 A} = \frac35$ , so the area is $\frac12 bc \sin A = \frac12 \cdot 2\sqrt5 \cdot 2\sqrt5 \cdot \frac35 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .

## Solution 7
Like in other solutions, we find that the three points of intersection are $(2, 2)$ , $(4, 6)$ , and $(6, 4)$ . The area of the triangle is half the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix determined by these points. \[\frac12\begin{Vmatrix} 2&2&1\\ 4&6&1\\ 6&4&1\\ \end{Vmatrix} = \frac12|-12| = \frac12 \cdot 12 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}\]

## Solution 8
Like in other solutions, we find the three points of intersection. Label these $A (2, 2)$ , $B (4, 6)$ , and $C (6, 4)$ . Then vectors $\overrightarrow{AB} = \langle 2, 4 \rangle$ and $\overrightarrow{AC} = \langle 4, 2 \rangle$ . The area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors. \[\frac12\begin{Vmatrix} i&j&k\\ 2&4&0\\ 4&2&0\\ \end{Vmatrix} = \frac12|-12k| = \frac12 \cdot 12 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}\]

## Solution 9
Like in other solutions, we find that the three points of intersection are $(2, 2)$ , $(4, 6)$ , and $(6, 4)$ . By the Pythagorean theorem, this is an isosceles triangle with base $2\sqrt2$ and equal length $2\sqrt5$ . The area of an isosceles triangle with base $b$ and equal length $l$ is $\frac{b\sqrt{4l^2-b^2}}{4}$ . Plugging in $b = 2\sqrt2$ and $l = 2\sqrt5$ , \[\frac{2\sqrt2 \cdot \sqrt{80-8}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}\]

## Solution 10 (Trig)
Like in other solutions, we find the three points of intersection. Label these $A (2, 2)$ , $B (4, 6)$ , and $C (6, 4)$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB = AC = 2\sqrt5$ and $BC = 2\sqrt2$ . By the Law of Cosines, \[\cos A = \frac{(2\sqrt5)^2 + (2\sqrt5)^2 - (2\sqrt2)^2}{2 \cdot 2\sqrt5 \cdot 2\sqrt5} = \frac{20 + 20 - 8}{40} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac45\] Therefore, $\sin A = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 A} = \frac35$ . By the extended Law of Sines, \[2R = \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{2\sqrt2}{\frac35} = \frac{10\sqrt2}{3}\] \[R = \frac{5\sqrt2}{3}\] Then the area is $\frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{2\sqrt2 \cdot 2\sqrt5^2}{4 \cdot \frac{5\sqrt2}{3}} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .

## Solution 11
The area of a triangle formed by three lines, \[a_1x + a_2y + a_3 = 0\] \[b_1x + b_2y + b_3 = 0\] \[c_1x + c_2y + c_3 = 0\] is the absolute value of \[\frac12 \cdot \frac{1}{(b_1c_2-b_2c_1)(a_1c_2-a_2c_1)(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)} \cdot \begin{vmatrix} a_1&a_2&a_3\\ b_1&b_2&b_3\\ c_1&c_2&c_3\\ \end{vmatrix}^2\] Plugging in the three lines, \[-x + 2y - 2 = 0\] \[-2x + y + 2 = 0\] \[x + y - 10 = 0\] the area is the absolute value of \[\frac12 \cdot \frac{1}{(-2-1)(-1-2)(-1+4)} \cdot \begin{vmatrix} -1&2&-2\\ -2&1&2\\ 1&1&-10\\ \end{vmatrix}^2 = \frac12 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot 18^2 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}\] Source: Orrick, Michael L. “THE AREA OF A TRIANGLE FORMED BY THREE LINES.” Pi Mu Epsilon Journal, vol. 7, no. 5, 1981, pp. 294–298.

## Solution 12 (Heron's Formula)
Like in other solutions, we find that our triangle is isosceles with legs of $2\sqrt5$ and base $2\sqrt2$ . Then, the semi - perimeter of our triangle is, \[\frac{4\sqrt5+2\sqrt2}{2} = 2\sqrt5 + \sqrt2.\] Applying Heron's formula, we find that the area of this triangle is equivalent to \[\sqrt{{(2\sqrt5+\sqrt2)}{(2\sqrt5-\sqrt2)}{(2)}} = \sqrt{{(20-2)}{(2)}} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}.\]

## Solution 13
Like in the other solutions, we find that the three points of intersection are $(2, 2)$ , $(4, 6)$ , and $(6, 4)$ . By the shoelace theorem, we have \[\dfrac{1}{2} \left|(2*4 + 6*6 + 4*2) - (2*6 + 4*4 + 6*2) \right|\] Evaluating this we get our answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}.$
