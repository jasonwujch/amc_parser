## Problem

What is the hundreds digit of $(20!-15!)?$

$\textbf{(A) }0\qquad\textbf{(B) }1\qquad\textbf{(C) }2\qquad\textbf{(D) }4\qquad\textbf{(E) }5$

## Solution 1
Because we know that $5^3$ is a factor of $15!$ and $20!$ , the last three digits of both numbers is a $0$ , this means that the difference of the hundreds digits is also $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0}$ .

## Solution 2
We can clearly see that $20! \equiv 15! \equiv 0 \pmod{1000}$ , so $20! - 15! \equiv 0 \pmod{100}$ meaning that the last two digits are equal to $00$ and the hundreds digit is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0}$ .

## Solution 3 (Brute Force)
$20!= 2432902008176640000$ and $15!= 1307674368000$
Then, we see that the hundreds digit is $0-0=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0}$ .

Please do not do this and only use this solution as a last resort.
Note for people not used to comp. math: This is a completely reasonable way to solve this problem.

## Solution 4 (Solution 1 but simpler)
The prime factorization of $15!$ (it is easier than it seems) is $2^(11) * 3^6 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11 * 13$
Notice that it includes $2^3 * 5^3$ which is 1000
Therefore 15! and 20! are both multiples of 1000, the hundreds place is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0}$ .
