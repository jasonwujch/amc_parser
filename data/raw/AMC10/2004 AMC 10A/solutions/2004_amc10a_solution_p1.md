## Problem

You and five friends need to raise $1500$ dollars in donations for a charity, dividing the fundraising equally. How many dollars will each of you need to raise?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 250\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 300 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 1500 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 7500 \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 9000$

## Solution
There are $6$ people to split the $1500$ dollars among, so each person must raise $\frac{1500}6=250$ dollars. $\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 250}$
