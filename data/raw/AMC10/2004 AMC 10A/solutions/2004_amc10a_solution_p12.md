# 2004 AMC 10A Problem 12

## Problem

Henry's Hamburger Haven offers its hamburgers with the following condiments: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and onions. A customer can choose one, two,or three meat patties and any collection of condiments. How many different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered?

$\text{(A) \ } 24 \qquad \text{(B) \ } 256 \qquad \text{(C) \ } 768 \qquad \text{(D) \ } 40,320 \qquad \text{(E) \ } 120,960$

## Solution
Think of the condiments as a set with 8 elements. There are $8$ total condiments to choose from. Therefore, there are $2^8=256$ ways to order the condiments. (You have two choices for each condiment- one choice is to include that condiment, and the other choice is to not include that condiment.) There are also $3$ choices for the meat, making a total of $256\times3=768$ possible hamburgers. $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 768}$
