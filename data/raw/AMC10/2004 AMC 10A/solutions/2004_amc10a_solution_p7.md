# 2004 AMC 10A Problem 7

## Problem

A grocer stacks oranges in a pyramid-like stack whose rectangular base is $5$ oranges by $8$ oranges. Each orange above the first level rests in a pocket formed by four oranges below. The stack is completed by a single row of oranges. How many oranges are in the stack?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 96 \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 98 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 100 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 101 \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 134$

## Solution
There are $5\times8=40$ oranges on the $1^{\text{st}}$ layer of the stack. The $2^{\text{nd}}$ layer that is added on top of the first will be a layer of $4\times7=28$ oranges. When the third layer is added on top of the $2^{\text{nd}}$ , it will be a layer of $3\times6=18$ oranges, etc.
Therefore, there are $5\times8+4\times7+3\times6+2\times5+1\times4=40+28+18+10+4=100$ oranges in the stack. $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 100}$
