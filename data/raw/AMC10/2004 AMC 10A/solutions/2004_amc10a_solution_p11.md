## Problem

A company sells peanut butter in cylindrical jars. Marketing research suggests that using wider jars will increase sales. If the diameter of the jars is increased by $25\%$ without altering the volume , by what percent must the height be decreased?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 10 \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 25 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 36 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 50 \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 60$

## Solution
When the diameter is increased by $25\%$ , it is increased by $\dfrac{5}{4}$ , so the area of the base is increased by $\left(\dfrac54\right)^2=\dfrac{25}{16}$ .
To keep the volume the same, the height must be $\dfrac{1}{\frac{25}{16}}=\dfrac{16}{25}$ of the original height, which is a $36\%$ reduction. $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 36}$
