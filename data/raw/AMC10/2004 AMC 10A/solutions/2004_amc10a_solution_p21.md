# 2004 AMC 10A Problem 21

## Problem

Two distinct lines pass through the center of three concentric circles of radii 3, 2, and 1. The area of the shaded region in the diagram is $\frac{8}{13}$ of the area of the unshaded region. What is the radian measure of the acute angle formed by the two lines? (Note: $\pi$ radian is $180$ degree.)

$\mathrm{(A) \ } \frac{\pi}{8} \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } \frac{\pi}{7} \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } \frac{\pi}{6} \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } \frac{\pi}{5} \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } \frac{\pi}{4}$

## Solution 1
Let the area of the shaded region be $S$ , the area of the unshaded region be $U$ , and the acute angle that is formed by the two lines be $\theta$ . We can set up two equations between $S$ and $U$ :
$S+U=9\pi$
$S=\dfrac{8}{13}U$
Thus $\dfrac{21}{13}U=9\pi$ , and $U=\dfrac{39\pi}{7}$ , and thus $S=\dfrac{8}{13}\cdot \dfrac{39\pi}{7}=\dfrac{24\pi}{7}$ .
Now we can make a formula for the area of the shaded region in terms of $\theta$ :
$\dfrac{2\theta}{2\pi} \cdot \pi +\dfrac{2(\pi-\theta)}{2\pi} \cdot (4\pi-\pi)+\dfrac{2\theta}{2\pi}(9\pi-4\pi)=\theta +3\pi-3\theta+5\theta=3\theta+3\pi=\dfrac{24\pi}{7}$
Thus $3\theta=\dfrac{3\pi}{7}\Rightarrow \theta=\dfrac{\pi}{7}\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{\pi}{7}}$

## Solution 2
As mentioned in Solution #1, we can make an equation for the area of the shaded region in terms of $\theta$ .
$\implies\dfrac{2\theta}{2\pi} \cdot \pi +\dfrac{2(\pi-\theta)}{2\pi} \cdot (4\pi-\pi)+\dfrac{2\theta}{2\pi}(9\pi-4\pi)=\theta +3\pi-3\theta+5\theta=3\theta+3\pi$ .
So, the shaded region is $3\theta+3\pi$ . This means that the unshaded region is $9\pi-(3\theta+3\pi)$ .
Also, the shaded region is $\frac{8}{13}$ of the unshaded region. Hence, we can now make an equation and solve for $\theta$ .
$3\theta+3\pi=\frac{8}{13}(9\pi-(3\theta+3\pi)\implies 39\theta+39\pi=8(6\pi-3\theta)\implies 39\theta+39\pi=48\pi-24\theta$ .
Simplifying, we get $63\theta=9\pi\implies \theta=\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{\pi}{7}}$

## Solution 3 (Quick Summary)
First, we can find the area of the shaded region, which turns out to be 24π/7. Then, we can set θ to be the acute angle. We get 6(θ)+3(180-θ)=(Area of shaded region). After we simplify, we get θ=π/7. Simplifying, we get (B)==>π/7. (If you have limited time and you find the area of the shaded region, you could make an educated guess and go for π/7 since the denominator is 7).
