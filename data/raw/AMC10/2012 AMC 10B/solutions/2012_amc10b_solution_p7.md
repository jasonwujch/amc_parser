# 2012 AMC 10B Problem 7

## Problem

For a science project, Sammy observed a chipmunk and a squirrel stashing acorns in holes. The chipmunk hid 3 acorns in each of the holes it dug. The squirrel hid 4 acorns in each of the holes it dug. They each hid the same number of acorns, although the squirrel needed 4 fewer holes. How many acorns did the chipmunk hide?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 42\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 48\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 54$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ be the number of acorns that both animals had.
So by the info in the problem:
$\frac{x}{3}=\left( \frac{x}{4} \right)+4$
Subtracting $\frac{x}{4}$ from both sides leaves
$\frac{x}{12}=4$
$\boxed{x=48}$
This is answer choice $\textbf{(D)}$

## Solution 2
Instead of an Algebraic Solution, we can just find a residue in the holes through common multiples of $3$ and $4$ , so $lcm[3,4]=12$ , the next largest is $12\cdot2=24$ , the next is $36$ , and so on, with all of them being multiples of $12$ , now we can see that per every common multiple, we can see a pattern such as
$12=4\cdot3=3\cdot4$ so $4-3=1$ hole less.
$24=4\cdot6=3\cdot8$ so $8-6=2$ holes less.
$36=4\cdot9=3\cdot12$ so $12-9=3$ holes less.
$48=4\cdot12=3\cdot16$ so $16-12=4$ holes less.
So we see that $48$ is the number we need which is $\textbf{48(D)}$

## Solution 3
We can also use two variables to solve this problem. If the chipmunk stashed his acorns in $x$ holes, and the squirrels stashed his acorns in $y$ holes. We can get two equations: $x$ = $y$ + 4 and 3 $x$ = 4 $y$ When we solve this equation we can get $x$ = 48, $y$ = 44. So the answer is $\textbf{48(D)}$ ~Mathlover1205
