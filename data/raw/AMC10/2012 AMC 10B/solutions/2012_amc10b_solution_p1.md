# 2012 AMC 10B Problem 1

## Problem

Each third-grade classroom at Pearl Creek Elementary has $18$ students and $2$ pet rabbits. How many more students than rabbits are there in all $4$ of the third-grade classrooms?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 48\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 56\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 64\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 72\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 80$

## Solution
In each class, there are $18-2=16$ more students than rabbits. So for all classrooms, the difference between students and rabbits is $16 \times 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 64}$
