# 2012 AMC 10B Problem 8

## Problem

What is the sum of all integer solutions to $1<(x-2)^2<25$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 19\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 25$

## Solution
$(x-2)^2$ = perfect square.
1 < perfect square < 25
Perfect square can equal: 4, 9, or 16
Solve for $x$ :
$(x-2)^2=4$
$x=4,0$
and
$(x-2)^2=9$
$x=5,-1$
and
$(x-2)^2=16$
$x=6,-2$
The sum of all integer solutions is
$4+5+6+0+(-1)+(-2)=\boxed{\textbf{(B)} 12}$
