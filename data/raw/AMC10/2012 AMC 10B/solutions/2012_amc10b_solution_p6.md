# 2012 AMC 10B Problem 6

## Problem

In order to estimate the value of $x-y$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers with $x > y > 0$ , Xiaoli rounded $x$ up by a small amount, rounded $y$ down by the same amount, and then subtracted her rounded values. Which of the following statements is necessarily correct?

$\textbf{(A) } \text{Her estimate is larger than } x-y \qquad \textbf{(B) } \text{Her estimate is smaller than } x-y \qquad \textbf{(C) } \text{Her estimate equals } x-y \\ \qquad \textbf{(D) } \text{Her estimate equals } y-x \qquad \textbf{(E) } \text{Her estimate is } 0$

## Solution
Let's define $z$ as the amount rounded up by and down by.
The problem statement tells us that Xiaoli performed the following computation:
$\left(x+z\right) - \left(y-z\right) = x+z-y+z = x-y+2z$
We can see that $x-y+2z$ is greater than $x-y$ , and so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \text{Her estimate is larger than } x-y}$ .
