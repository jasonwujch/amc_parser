## Problem

Two equilateral triangles are contained in square whose side length is $2\sqrt 3$ . The bases of these triangles are the opposite side of the square, and their intersection is a rhombus. What is the area of the rhombus?

$\text{(A) } \frac{3}{2} \qquad \text{(B) } \sqrt 3 \qquad \text{(C) } 2\sqrt 2 - 1 \qquad \text{(D) } 8\sqrt 3 - 12 \qquad \text{(E)} \frac{4\sqrt 3}{3}$

## Solution
Observe that the rhombus is made up of two congruent equilateral triangles with side length equal to GF. Since AE has length $\sqrt{3}$ and triangle AEF is a 30-60-90 triangle, it follows that EF has length 1. By symmetry, HG also has length 1. Thus GF has length $2\sqrt{3} - 2$ . The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle of length $s$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$ . It follows that the area of the rhombus is:
$2\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(2\sqrt{3}-2)^2 = \boxed{\mathbf{(D)} 8\sqrt{3} - 12}.$

## Solution 2
We know that both of these triangles are congruent with base length $2\sqrt{3}$ . Using 30-60-90 triangle rules, we find the height of both of these triangles to be $3$ . Since the height of the square is $2\sqrt{3}$ , we can see that $3+3-$ (overlap) $=2\sqrt{3}$ . Solving this we get that the overlap is $6-2\sqrt{3}$ . This overlap is one of the diagonals of the rhombus. Now, it is convenient to understand that the rhombus is made up of 4 congruent 30-60-90 triangles. The height of one of these triangles is half the diagonal that we have found already. Dividing by two, we get the height of one triangle $= 3-\sqrt{3}$ . Because the triangles are 30-60-90, we can find the base to be $\sqrt{3}-1$ . We use the area of a triangle formula to get the area of one of these four triangles to be $\dfrac{(3-\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3}-1)}{2}=\dfrac{4\sqrt{3}-6}{2}=2\sqrt{3}-3$ Lastly, since there were four of these triangles in the rhombus, we do $(2\sqrt{3}-3)\times 4 = \boxed{\mathbf{(D)} 8\sqrt{3} - 12}.$
