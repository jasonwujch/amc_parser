## Problem

The least common multiple of a positive integer $n$ and $18$ is $180$ , and the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $45$ is $15$ . What is the sum of the digits of $n$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 8 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 12$

## Solution 1
Note that \begin{align*} 18 &= 2\cdot3^2, \\ 180 &= 2^2\cdot3^2\cdot5, \\ 45 &= 3^2\cdot5 \\ 15 &= 3\cdot5. \end{align*} Let $n = 2^a\cdot3^b\cdot5^c.$ It follows that:
1. From the least common multiple condition, we have \[\operatorname{lcm}(n,18) = \operatorname{lcm}(2^a\cdot3^b\cdot5^c,2\cdot3^2) = 2^{\max(a,1)}\cdot3^{\max(b,2)}\cdot5^{\max(c,0)} = 2^2\cdot3^2\cdot5,\] from which $a=2, b\in\{0,1,2\},$ and $c=1.$
1. From the greatest common divisor condition, we have \[\gcd(n,45) = \gcd(2^2\cdot3^b\cdot5,3^2\cdot5) = 2^{\min(2,0)}\cdot3^{\min(b,2)}\cdot5^{\min(1,1)} = 3\cdot5,\] from which $b=1.$
Together, we conclude that $n=2^2\cdot3\cdot5=60.$ The sum of its digits is $6+0=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 6}.$

## Solution 2
The options for $\text{lcm}(x, 18)=180$ are $20$ , $60$ , and $180$ . The options for $\text{gcd}(y, 45)=15$ are $15$ , $30$ , $60$ , $75$ , etc. We see that $60$ appears in both lists; therefore, $6+0=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 6}$ .

### Remark
If you ignore or mess up the LCM, and get $n=15$ , you'll still get the correct answer.
