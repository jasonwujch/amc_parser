## Problem

A list of $11$ positive integers has a mean of $10$ , a median of $9$ , and a unique mode of $8$ . What is the largest possible value of an integer in the list?

$\textbf {(A) } 24 \qquad \textbf {(B) } 30 \qquad \textbf {(C) } 31\qquad \textbf {(D) } 33 \qquad \textbf {(E) } 35$

## Solution 1
We start off with the fact that the median is $9$ , so we must have $a, b, c, d, e, 9, f, g, h, i, j$ , listed in ascending order. Note that the integers do not have to be distinct.
Since the mode is $8$ , we have to have at least $2$ occurrences of $8$ in the list. If there are $2$ occurrences of $8$ in the list, we will have $a, b, c, 8, 8, 9, f, g, h, i, j$ . In this case, since $8$ is the unique mode, the rest of the integers have to be distinct. So we minimize $a,b,c,f,g,h,i$ in order to maximize $j$ . If we let the list be $1,2,3,8,8,9,10,11,12,13,j$ , then $j = 11 \times 10 - (1+2+3+8+8+9+10+11+12+13) = 33$ .
Next, consider the case where there are $3$ occurrences of $8$ in the list. Now, we can have two occurrences of another integer in the list. We try $1,1,8,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,j$ . Following the same process as above, we get $j = 11 \times 10 - (1+1+8+8+8+9+9+10+10+11) = 35$ . As this is the highest choice in the list, we know this is our answer. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }35}$

## Solution 2
Note that $x_1 + \ldots + x_{11} = 110$ let $x_6 = 9$ so $x_1 + \ldots + x_5 + x_7 + \ldots + x_{11} = 101$ . To maximize the value of $x_i$ where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $11$ , we let any $7$ elements be $1,2,\ldots,7$ so $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 57$ . Now we have to let one of above $3$ values = $8$ hence $x_1 + x_2 = 49$ now let $x_1 = 35$ , $x_2 = 14$ hence $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }35}$ is the answer.
