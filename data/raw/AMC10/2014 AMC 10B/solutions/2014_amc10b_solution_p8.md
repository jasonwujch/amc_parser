# 2014 AMC 10B Problem 8

## Problem

A truck travels $\dfrac{b}{6}$ feet every $t$ seconds. There are $3$ feet in a yard. How many yards does the truck travel in $3$ minutes?

$\textbf {(A) } \frac{b}{1080t} \qquad \textbf {(B) } \frac{30t}{b} \qquad \textbf {(C) } \frac{30b}{t}\qquad \textbf {(D) } \frac{10t}{b} \qquad \textbf {(E) } \frac{10b}{t}$

## Solution
Converting feet to yards and minutes to second, we see that the truck travels $\dfrac{b}{18}$ yards every $t$ seconds for $180$ seconds. We see that he does $\dfrac{180}{t}$ cycles of $\dfrac{b}{18}$ yards. Multiplying, we get $\dfrac{180b}{18t}$ , or $\dfrac{10b}{t}$ , or $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}}$ .

## Solution 2
We set a proportion by letting the $x$ being the number of feet the truck travels in $3$ minutes.
\begin{align*} \frac{\frac{b}{6}}{t} &= \frac{x}{180} \\ \frac{b}{6t} &= \frac{x}{180} \\ \frac{180b}{6t} &= x \\ x &= \frac{30b}{t} \end{align*}
Remember $x$ is the number of feet the truck travels, so we divide by $3$ to convert to yards.
$\frac{x}{3}=\frac{10b}{t}$ , which corresponds to $\boxed{\text{(E)}}$
