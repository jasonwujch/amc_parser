# 2014 AMC 10B Problem 5

## Problem

Doug constructs a square window using $8$ equal-size panes of glass, as shown. The ratio of the height to width for each pane is $5 : 2$ , and the borders around and between the panes are $2$ inches wide. In inches, what is the side length of the square window?

[asy] fill((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,26)--(0,26)--cycle,gray); fill((6,0)--(8,0)--(8,26)--(6,26)--cycle,gray); fill((12,0)--(14,0)--(14,26)--(12,26)--cycle,gray); fill((18,0)--(20,0)--(20,26)--(18,26)--cycle,gray); fill((24,0)--(26,0)--(26,26)--(24,26)--cycle,gray); fill((0,0)--(26,0)--(26,2)--(0,2)--cycle,gray); fill((0,12)--(26,12)--(26,14)--(0,14)--cycle,gray); fill((0,24)--(26,24)--(26,26)--(0,26)--cycle,gray); [/asy]

$\textbf{(A)}\ 26\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 28\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 32\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 34$

## Solution
We note that the total length must be the same as the total height, as it is given in the problem. Calling the width of each small rectangle $2x$ , and the height $5x$ , we can see that the length is composed of $4$ widths and $5$ bars of length $2$ . This is equal to two heights of the small rectangles as well as $3$ bars of $2$ . Thus, $4(2x) + 5(2) = 2(5x) + 3(2)$ . We quickly find that $x = 2$ . The total side length is $4(4) + 5(2) = 2(10) + 3(2) = 26$ , or $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$ .
