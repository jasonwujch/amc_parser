# 2014 AMC 10B Problem 7

## Problem

Suppose $A>B>0$ and A is $x$ % greater than $B$ . What is $x$ ?

$\textbf {(A) } 100\left(\frac{A-B}{B}\right) \qquad \textbf {(B) } 100\left(\frac{A+B}{B}\right) \qquad \textbf {(C) } 100\left(\frac{A+B}{A}\right)\qquad \textbf {(D) } 100\left(\frac{A-B}{A}\right) \qquad \textbf {(E) } 100\left(\frac{A}{B}\right)$

## Solution
We have that A is $x\%$ greater than B, so $A=\frac{100+x}{100}(B)$ . We solve for $x$ . We get
$\frac{A}{B}=\frac{100+x}{100}$
$100\frac{A}{B}=100+x$
$100\left(\frac{A}{B}-1\right)=x$
$100\left(\frac{A-B}{B}\right)=x$ . $\boxed{\left(\textbf{A}\right)}$

## Solution 2
The question is basically asking the percentage increase from $B$ to $A$ . We know the formula for percentage increase is $\frac{\text{New-Original}}{\text{Original}}$ . We know the new is $A$ and the original is $B$ . We also must multiple by $100$ to get $x$ out of it's fractional/decimal form. Therefore, the answer is $100\left(\frac{A-B}{B}\right)$ or $\boxed{\text{A}}$ .

## Solution 3 (Answer Choices)
Without loss of generality, let $A = 125$ and $B = 100,$ forcing $x$ to be $25$ . Plugging our values for $A$ and $B$ into these answer choices, we find that only $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$ returns $25$ .
