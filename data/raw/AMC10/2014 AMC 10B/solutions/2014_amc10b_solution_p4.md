# 2014 AMC 10B Problem 4

## Problem

Susie pays for $4$ muffins and $3$ bananas. Calvin spends twice as much paying for $2$ muffins and $16$ bananas. A muffin is how many times as expensive as a banana?

$\textbf {(A) } \frac{3}{2} \qquad \textbf {(B) } \frac{5}{3} \qquad \textbf {(C) } \frac{7}{4} \qquad \textbf {(D) } 2 \qquad \textbf {(E) } \frac{13}{4}$

## Solution
Let $m$ be the cost of a muffin and $b$ be the cost of a banana. From the given information, \[2m+16b=2(4m+3b)=8m+6b\Rightarrow 10b=6m\Rightarrow m=\frac{10}{6}b=\boxed{\frac{5}{3}\rightarrow \text{(B)}}\] .
