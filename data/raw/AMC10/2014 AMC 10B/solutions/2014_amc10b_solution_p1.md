## Problem

Leah has $13$ coins, all of which are pennies and nickels. If she had one more nickel than she has now, then she would have the same number of pennies and nickels. In cents, how much are Leah's coins worth?

$\textbf {(A) } 33 \qquad \textbf {(B) } 35 \qquad \textbf {(C) } 37 \qquad \textbf {(D) } 39 \qquad \textbf {(E) } 41$

## Solution
If Leah has $1$ more nickel, she has $14$ total coins. Because she has the same number of nickels and pennies, she has $7$ nickels and $7$ pennies. This is after the nickel has been added, so we must subtract $1$ nickel to get $6$ nickels and $7$ pennies. Therefore, Leah has $6\cdot5+7=\boxed{37 (\textbf{C})}$ cents.
