# 2024 AMC 10B Problem 1

## Problem

In a long line of people arranged left to right, the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. How many people are in the line?

$\textbf{(A) } 2021 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 2022 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 2023 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 2024 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 2025$

### Modified Problem in Certain China Testpapers

In a long line of people arranged left to right, the 1015th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. How many people are in line?

$\textbf{(A) } 2021 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 2022 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 2023 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 2024 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 2025$

## Solution for Certain China Testpapers
If the person is the 1015th from the left, that means there is 1014 people to their left. If the person is the 1010th from the right, that means there is 1009 people to their right. Therefore, there are $1014 + 1 + 1009 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 2024}$ people in line.

## Solution 1
If the person is the 1013th from the left, that means there is 1012 people to their left. If the person is the 1010th from the right, that means there is 1009 people to their right. Therefore, there are $1012 + 1 + 1009 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2022}$ people in line.

## Solution 2
The person is $1013$ rd person from the left is also the $1010$ th person from the right, so the same person is counted twice.
Therefore, there are $1013+1010-1=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2022}$ people in line.
$\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2022}$

## Solution 3
We can look at a smaller case where it is the $4$ th person from the left and the $2$ nd person from the right. Listing out the people as numbers gives us a list of $1,2,3,4,5.$ We see that the total number of people is the position from the left + the position from the right - 1, which in the case above is $4+2-1=5.$ Plugging in $1013$ and $1010$ gives us $1013+1010-1=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2022}$

## Solution 4
Since the person is the 1013th person from the left and the 1010th person from the right, there are 1009 people after the 1013th person.
Therefore, there are 1013 + 1009 = $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2022}$ people in line.
(Note: Similarly, you can perceive this information as 1012 people to the left of 1010 people and proceed.)

## Solution 5
Think of a Pattern
If 4 people: p1, p2, p3, p4 and you are 2nd from right and third from left
So just add 1013+1010 and subtract 1 since you are overcounting yourself twice.
We then get, 1013 + 1009 = $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2022}$
