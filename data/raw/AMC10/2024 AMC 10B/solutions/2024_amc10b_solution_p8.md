# 2024 AMC 10B Problem 8

## Problem

Let $N$ be the product of all the positive integer divisors of $42$ . What is the units digit of $N$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 0\qquad\textbf{(B) } 2\qquad\textbf{(C) } 4\qquad\textbf{(D) } 6\qquad\textbf{(E) } 8$

## Solution 1
The factors of $42$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42$ . Multiply the unit digits to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 6}$

## Solution 2
The product of the factors of a number $n$ is $n^\frac{\tau(n)}{2}$ , where $\tau(n)$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$ . We see that $42 = 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 7^1$ has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 8$ factors, so the product of the divisors of $42$ is
\[42^{\frac{8}{2}} \equiv 42^4 \equiv 2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 6} \pmod{10}.\]
