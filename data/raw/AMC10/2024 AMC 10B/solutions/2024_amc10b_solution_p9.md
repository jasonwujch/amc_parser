# 2024 AMC 10B Problem 9

## Problem

Real numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ have arithmetic mean $0$ . The arithmetic mean of $a^2, b^2,$ and $c^2$ is $10$ . What is the arithmetic mean of $ab, ac,$ and $bc$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } -5 \qquad\textbf{(B) } -\dfrac{10}{3} \qquad\textbf{(C) } -\dfrac{10}{9} \qquad\textbf{(D) } 0 \qquad\textbf{(E) } \dfrac{10}{9}$

## Solution 1
If $\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 0$ , that means $a+b+c=0$ , and $(a+b+c)^2=0$ . Expanding that gives \[(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2ac+2bc\] If $\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{3} = 10$ , then $a^2+b^2+c^2=30$ . Thus, we have \[30 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 0\] Arithmetic will give you that $ab + bc + ac = -15$ . To find the arithmetic mean, divide that by 3, so $\frac{ab + bc + ac}{3} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }-5}$

## Solution 2 (Simple Algebra)
Since $\frac{a+b+c}{3},$ we have $a+b+c=0,$ and \[(a+b+c)^2= a^2 + b^2+c^2+2(ab+ac+bc)=0\]
From the second given, $\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{3} = 10$ , so $a^2+b^2+c^3=30.$ Substituting this into the above equation, \[2(ab+ac+bc) = (a+b+c)^2 -(a^2+b^2+c^2)=0-30 = -30.\] Thus, $ab+ac+bc=-15,$ and their arithmetic mean is $\frac{-15}{3} = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -5}.$

## Solution 3
Assume that $a = 0$ and $b = -c$ . Since we know that the arithmetic mean of the three numbers is $10$ , this means $a^2+b^2+c^2=30$ . Using this equation, $b^{2} + b^{2} = 30$ , so $b^2 = 15$ . Observe that taking the positive or negative root won't matter as $c$ will be the opposite. If we let $b = \sqrt{15}$ and $c = -\sqrt{15}$ , $ab = 0\times\sqrt{15} = 0$ , $ac = 0\times-\sqrt{15} = 0$ , and $bc = \sqrt{15}\times-\sqrt{15} = -15$ , so $ab+ac+bc=-15$ . Doing $\frac{-15}{3}$ to get the arithmetic mean will give us $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -5}$ .

## Solution 4 (interesting property)
From the definition of arithmetic means and some simple manipulation, we have $a+b+c=0$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=30$ . Let $ab+ac+bc=k$ , we have:
\[k=ab+ac+bc=(a+b)c+ab\]
Substituting $c=-(a+b)$ into the expression, we have
\[-c^2+ab=k\]
Adding twice the equation above to $a^2+b^2+c^2=30$ , we have:
\[a^2+b^2+c^2-2c^2+2ab=30+2k\]
\[a^2+b^2+2ab-c^2=30+2k\]
\[(a+b)^2-c^2=30+2k\]
\[(a+b+c)(a+b-c)=30+2k\]
But we know that $a+b+c=0$ . So $30+2k=0$ and $k=-15$ . Therefore the arithmetic mean of $ab,ac,bc$ is $\frac{k}{3}=-5$ . So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -5}$
