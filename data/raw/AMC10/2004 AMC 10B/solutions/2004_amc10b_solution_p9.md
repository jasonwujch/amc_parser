# 2004 AMC 10B Problem 9

## Problem

A square has sides of length $10$ , and a circle centered at one of its vertices has radius $10$ . What is the area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle?

$\mathrm{(A)\ }200+25\pi\quad\mathrm{(B)\ }100+75\pi\quad\mathrm{(C)\ }75+100\pi\quad\mathrm{(D)\ }100+100\pi\quad\mathrm{(E)\ }100+125\pi$

## Solution
The area of the circle is $S_{\bigcirc}=100\pi$ ; the area of the square is $S_{\square}=100$ .
Exactly $\frac{1}{4}$ of the circle lies inside the square. Thus the total area is $\dfrac34 S_{\bigcirc}+S_{\square}=\boxed{\mathrm{(B)\ }100+75\pi}$ .
