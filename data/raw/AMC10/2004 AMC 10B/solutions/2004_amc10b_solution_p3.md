# 2004 AMC 10B Problem 3

## Problem

At each basketball practice last week, Jenny made twice as many free throws as she made at the previous practice. At her fifth practice she made $48$ free throws. How many free throws did she make at the first practice?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 3 \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 6 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 9 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 12\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 15$

## Solution
At the fourth practice she made $48/2=24$ throws, at the third one it was $24/2=12$ , then we get $12/2=6$ throws for the second practice, and finally $6/2=3\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 3}$ throws at the first one.
