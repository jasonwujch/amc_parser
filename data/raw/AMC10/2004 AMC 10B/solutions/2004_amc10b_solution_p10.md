# 2004 AMC 10B Problem 10

## Problem

A grocer makes a display of cans in which the top row has one can and each lower row has two more cans than the row above it. If the display contains $100$ cans, how many rows does it contain?

$\mathrm{(A)\ }5\qquad\mathrm{(B)\ }8\qquad\mathrm{(C)\ }9\qquad\mathrm{(D)\ }10\qquad\mathrm{(E)\ }11$

## Solution
The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^2$ . As in our case $n^2=100$ , we have $n=\boxed{\mathrm{(D)\ }10}$ .
