# 2004 AMC 10B Problem 5

## Problem

In the expression $c\cdot a^b-d$ , the values of $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ are $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ , although not necessarily in that order. What is the maximum possible value of the result?

$\mathrm{(A)\ }5\qquad\mathrm{(B)\ }6\qquad\mathrm{(C)\ }8\qquad\mathrm{(D)\ }9\qquad\mathrm{(E)\ }10$

## Solution
If $a=0$ or $c=0$ , the expression evaluates to $-d<0$ . If $b=0$ , the expression evaluates to $c-d\leq 2$ . Case $d=0$ remains. In that case, we want to maximize $c\cdot a^b$ where $\{a,b,c\}=\{1,2,3\}$ . Trying out the six possibilities we get that the greatest is $(a,b,c)=(3,2,1)$ , where $c\cdot a^b=1\cdot 3^2=\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 9}$ .
