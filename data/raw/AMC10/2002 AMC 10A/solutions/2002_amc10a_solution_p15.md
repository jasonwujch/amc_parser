# 2002 AMC 10A Problem 15

## Problem

Using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, form 4 two-digit prime numbers, using each digit only once. What is the sum of the 4 prime numbers?

$\text{(A)}\ 150 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 160 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 170 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 180 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 190$

## Solution
Since a multiple-digit prime number is not divisible by either 2 or 5, it must end with 1, 3, 7, or 9 in the units place. The remaining digits given must therefore appear in the tens place. Hence our answer is $20 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 9 = 190\Rightarrow\boxed{(E)= 190}$ .
(Note that we did not need to actually construct the primes. If we had to, one way to match the tens and ones digits to form four primes is $23$ , $41$ , $59$ , and $67$ .)
(You could also guess the numbers, if you have a lot of spare time.)
