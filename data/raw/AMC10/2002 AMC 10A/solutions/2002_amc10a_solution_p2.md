# 2002 AMC 10A Problem 2

## Problem

Given that a, b, and c are non-zero real numbers, define $(a, b, c) = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a}$ , find $(2, 12, 9)$ .

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 6 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 7 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 8$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
$(2, 12, 9)=\frac{2}{12}+\frac{12}{9}+\frac{9}{2}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{4}{3}+\frac{9}{2}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{8}{6}+\frac{27}{6}=\frac{36}{6}=6$ . Our answer is then $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .

## Solution 2
Without computing the answer exactly, we see that $2/12=\text{a little}$ , $12/9=\text{more than }1$ , and $9/2=4.5$ . The sum is $4.5 + (\text{more than }1) + (\text{a little}) = (\text{more than }5.5) + (\text{a little})$ , and as all the options are integers, the correct one is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ .
