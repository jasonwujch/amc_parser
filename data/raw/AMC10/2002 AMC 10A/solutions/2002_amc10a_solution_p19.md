# 2002 AMC 10A Problem 19

## Problem

Spot's doghouse has a regular hexagonal base that measures one yard on each side. He is tethered to a vertex with a two-yard rope. What is the area, in square yards, of the region outside of the doghouse that Spot can reach?

$\text{(A)}\ 2\pi/3 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 2\pi \qquad \text{(C)}\ 5\pi/2 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 8\pi/3 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 3\pi$

## Solution
Part of what Spot can reach is $\frac{240}{360}=\frac{2}{3}$ of a circle with radius 2, which gives him $\frac{8\pi}{3}$ . He can also reach two $\frac{60}{360}$ parts of a unit circle, which combines to give $\frac{\pi}{3}$ . The total area is then $3\pi$ , which gives $\boxed{\text{(E)}}$ .
### Note
We can clearly see that the area must be more than $\frac{8\pi}{3}$ , and the only such answer is $\boxed{\text{(E)}}$ .
