# 2002 AMC 10A Problem 6

## Problem

Cindy was asked by her teacher to subtract 3 from a certain number and then divide the result by 9. Instead, she subtracted 9 and then divided the result by 3, giving an answer of 43. What would her answer have been had she worked the problem correctly?

$\textbf{(A) } 15\qquad \textbf{(B) } 34\qquad \textbf{(C) } 43\qquad \textbf{(D) } 51\qquad \textbf{(E) } 138$

## Solution
We work backwards; the number that Cindy started with is $3(43)+9=138$ . Now, the correct result is $\frac{138-3}{9}=\frac{135}{9}=15$ . Our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }15}$ .

## Solution 2
Let the number be $x$ . We transform the problem into an equation: $\frac{x-9}{3}=43$ . Solve for $x$ gives us $x=138$ . Therefore, the correct result is $\frac{138-3}{9}=\frac{135}{9}=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }15}$ .
