# 2002 AMC 10A Problem 9

## Problem

There are 3 numbers A, B, and C, such that $1001C - 2002A = 4004$ , and $1001B + 3003A = 5005$ . What is the average of A, B, and C?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 6 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 9 \qquad \textbf{(E) }\text{Not uniquely determined}$

## Solution
Notice that we don't need to find what $A, B,$ and $C$ actually are, just their average. In other words, if we can find $A+B+C$ , we will be done.
Adding up the equations gives $1001(A+B+C)=9009=1001(9)$ so $A+B+C=9$ and the average is $\frac{9}{3}=3$ . Our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }3}$ .

## Solution 2
As there are only 2 equations and 3 variables, just set one of the variables to something convenient, like 0. Setting C as 0, we get A is -2, and B is 11 by substitution. By basic arithmetic the average is 3=>B

## Solution 3
Start by isolating $B$ and $C$ in both of the equations, in order to represent the variables $C$ and $B$ in terms of A. Ending up with the two equations $C = 2A +4$ and $B = -3A + 5$ , we have to calculate the value of the expression $\frac{A+B+C}{3}$ . Plugging in $2A + 4$ for $C$ and $-3A + 5$ for $B$ , we add them up and end up with a value of 9. Dividing 9 by 3 to compute the average, we get our answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }3}$ .
