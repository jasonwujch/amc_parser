# 2023 AMC 10B Problem 9

## Problem

The numbers $16$ and $25$ are a pair of consecutive positive squares whose difference is $9$ . How many pairs of consecutive positive perfect squares have a difference of less than or equal to $2023$ ?

$\text{(A)}\ 674 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 1011 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 1010 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 2019 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 2017$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ be the square root of the smaller of the two perfect squares. Then, $(x+1)^2 - x^2 =x^2+2x+1-x^2 = 2x+1 \le 2023$ . Thus, $x \le 1011$ . So there are $\boxed{\text{(B)}1011}$ numbers that satisfy the equation.

Minor corrections by ~milquetoast
Note from ~milquetoast: Alternatively, you can let $x$ be the square root of the larger number, but if you do that, keep in mind that $x=1$ must be rejected, since $(x-1)$ cannot be $0$ .

## Solution 2
The smallest number that can be expressed as the difference of a pair of consecutive positive squares is $3$ , which is $2^2-1^2$ . The largest number that can be expressed as the difference of a pair of consecutive positive squares that is less than or equal to $2023$ is $2023$ , which is $1012^2-1011^2$ . These numbers are in the form $(x+1)^2-x^2$ , which is just $2x+1$ . These numbers are just the odd numbers from 3 to 2023, so there are $[(2023-3)/2]+1=1011$ such numbers. The answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)}1011}$ .

## Solution 3
The difference of 2 consecutive positive integer squares is always an odd number (proved from above). Therefore, the total number of cases is \(\left\lfloor \frac{2023}{2} \right\rfloor\) = $\boxed{B.1011}$

## Solution 4
Notice that the difference of two consecutive squares can be represented as $(x + 1) ^ 2 - x ^ 2$ . Using the Difference of Squares Formula, we simplify to get $(2x + 1)(1) = 2x + 1$ The number given in the problem was 2023, and thus we find that $x = \frac{2023 - 1}{2} \Rightarrow \boxed{\text{(B) 1011}}$ .
