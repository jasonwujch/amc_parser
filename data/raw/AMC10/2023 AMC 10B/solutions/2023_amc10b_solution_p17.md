## Problem

A rectangular box $\mathcal{P}$ has distinct edge lengths $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . The sum of the lengths of all $12$ edges of $\mathcal{P}$ is $13$ , the areas of all $6$ faces of $\mathcal{P}$ is $\frac{11}{2}$ , and the volume of $\mathcal{P}$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ . What is the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of $\mathcal{P}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}~2\qquad\textbf{(B)}~\frac{3}{8}\qquad\textbf{(C)}~\frac{9}{8}\qquad\textbf{(D)}~\frac{9}{4}\qquad\textbf{(E)}~\frac{3}{2}$

## Solution 1 (algebraic manipulation)
[asy] import geometry; pair A = (-3, 4); pair B = (-3, 5); pair C = (-1, 4); pair D = (-1, 5); pair AA = (0, 0); pair BB = (0, 1); pair CC = (2, 0); pair DD = (2, 1); draw(D--AA,dashed); draw(A--B); draw(A--C); draw(B--D); draw(C--D); draw(A--AA); draw(B--BB); draw(C--CC); draw(D--DD); // Dotted vertices dot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(AA); dot(BB); dot(CC); dot(DD); draw(AA--BB); draw(AA--CC); draw(BB--DD); draw(CC--DD); label("a",midpoint(D--DD),E); label("b",midpoint(CC--DD),E); label("c",midpoint(AA--CC),S); [/asy]
We can create three equations using the given information. \[4a+4b+4c = 13\] \[2ab+2ac+2bc=\frac{11}{2}\] \[abc=\frac{1}{2}\] We also know that we want $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$ because that is the length that can be found from using the Pythagorean Theorem. We cleverly notice that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+ac+bc)$ . We know that $a+b+c = \frac{13}{4}$ and $2(ab+ac+bc)=\dfrac{11}2$ , so $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \left(\frac{13}{4}\right)^2 - \frac{11}{2} = \frac{169-88}{16} = \frac{81}{16}$ . So our answer is $\sqrt{\frac{81}{16}} = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}~\tfrac94}$ .

## Solution 2 (Vieta's)
We use the equations from Solution 1 and manipulate it a little: \[a+b+c = \frac{13}{4}\] \[ab+ac+bc=\frac{11}{4}\] \[abc=\frac{1}{2}\] Notice how these are the equations for the vieta's formulas for a polynomial with roots of $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . Let's create that polynomial. It would be $x^3 - \frac{13}{4}x^2 + \frac{11}{4}x - \frac{1}{2}$ . Multiplying each term by 4 to get rid of fractions, we get $4x^3 - 13x^2 + 11x - 2$ . Notice how the coefficients add up to $0$ . Whenever this happens, that means that $(x-1)$ is a factor and that 1 is a root. After using synthetic division to divide $4x^3 - 13x^2 + 11x - 2$ by $x-1$ , we get $4x^2 - 9x + 2$ . Factoring that, you get $(x-2)(4x-1)$ . This means that this polynomial factors to $(x-1)(x-2)(4x-1)$ and that the roots are $1$ , $2$ , and $1/4$ . Since we're looking for $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$ , this is equal to $\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + \frac{1}{4}^2} = \sqrt{\frac{81}{16}} = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}~\tfrac94}$

## Solution 3 (Newton's Sums)
Same formal process of Solution 2, once we have $4x^3 - 13x^2 + 11x - 2$ . Let $s_{2} = a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ and $s_{1} = a + b + c = \frac{13}{4}$ . Applying Newton's Sums , we have \[(4)s_{2} + (-13)s_{1} + 2 * 11 = 0\] . We can solve that $s_{2} = \frac{81}{16}$ , and the interior diagonal would be \[\sqrt{s_{2}} = \frac{9}{4}\] .

## Solution 4 (Cheese Method)
Incorporating the solution above, we know $a+b+c$ = $13/4$ $\Rightarrow$ $a+b+c > 3$ . The side lengths are larger than $1$ $\cdot$ $1$ $\cdot$ $1$ (a unit cube). The side length of the interior of a unit cube is $\sqrt{3}$ , and we know that the side lengths are larger than $1$ $\cdot$ $1$ $\cdot$ $1$ , so that means the diagonal has to be larger than $\sqrt{3}$ , and the only answer choice larger than $\sqrt{3}$ $\Rightarrow$ $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~\tfrac94}$

Note that the real number $\sqrt{3}$ is around $1.73$ . Option $A$ is also greater than $\sqrt{3}$ meaning there are two options greater than $\sqrt{3}$ . Option $A$ is an integer so educationally guessing we arrive at answer $D$ $\Rightarrow$ $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~\tfrac94}$
