# 2023 AMC 10B Problem 2

## Problem

Carlos went to a sports store to buy running shoes. Running shoes were on sale, with prices reduced by $20\%$ on every pair of shoes. Carlos also knew that he had to pay a $7.5\%$ sales tax on the discounted price. He had $\$43$ dollars. What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy?

$\textbf{(A) }\$46\qquad\textbf{(B) }\$50\qquad\textbf{(C) }\$48\qquad\textbf{(D) }\$47\qquad\textbf{(E) }\$49$

## Solution 1
Let the price originally be \( x \). Then, after a \(20\) percent discount, the price is now \( x - \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{4}{5}x \).
From the discounted price \( \frac{4}{5}x \), we now take \( \frac{7.5}{100} \) of \( \frac{4}{5}x \) and add it to \( \frac{4}{5}x \), giving us \( \frac{4}{5}x + \left(\frac{7.5}{100}\right)\left(\frac{4}{5}x\right) = \frac{4}{5}x + \frac{30}{500}x = \frac{4}{5}x + \frac{3}{50}x = \frac{43}{50}x \).
Now we write the inequality \( \frac{43}{50}x \leq \$43 \) and multiply by \( \frac{50}{43} \) on both sides to get \( x \leq \$50 \).
We want the greatest original price, which would be \($50\) or option choice \(B\).

## Solution 2 (easy)
We can create the equation: \[0.8x \cdot 1.075 = 43\] using the information given. This is because x, the original price, got reduced by 20%, or multiplied by 0.8, and it also got multiplied by 1.075 on the discounted price. Solving that equation, we get \[\frac{4}{5} \cdot x \cdot \frac{43}{40} = 43\] \[\frac{4}{5} \cdot x \cdot \frac{1}{40} = 1\] \[\frac{1}{5} \cdot x \cdot \frac{1}{10} = 1\] \[x = \boxed{50}\]

## Solution 3 (One-Step Equation)
The discounted shoe is $20\%$ off the original price. So that means $1 - 0.2 = 0.8$ . There is also a $7.5\%$ sales tax charge, so $0.8 * 1.075 = 0.86$ . Now we can set up the equation $0.86x = 43$ , and solving that we get $x=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }50}$ ~ kabbybear

## Solution 4
Let the original price be $x$ dollars. After the discount, the price becomes $80\%\cdot x$ dollars. After tax, the price becomes $80\% \times (1+7.5\%) = 86\% \cdot x$ dollars. So, $43=86\% \cdot x$ , $x=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\$50}.$

## Solution 5
We can assign a variable $c$ to represent the original cost of the shoes. Next, we set up the equation $80\%\cdot107.5\%\cdot c=43$ . We can solve this equation for $c$ and get $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\$50}$ .

## Solution 6 (Intuition and Guessing)
We know the discount price will be 5/4, and 0.075 is equal to 3/40. So we look at answer choice $\textbf{(B) }$ , see that the discount price will be 40, and with sales tax applied it will be 43, so the answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\$50}$ .
