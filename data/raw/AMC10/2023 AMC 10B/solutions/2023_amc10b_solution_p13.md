## Solution 1
First consider, $|x-1|+|y-1| \le 1.$ We can see that it is a square with a side length of $\sqrt{2}$ (diagonal $2$ ). The area of the square is $\sqrt{2}^2 = 2.$
Next, we insert an absolute value sign into the equation and get $|x-1|+||y|-1| \le 1.$ This will double the square reflecting over x-axis.
So now we have $2$ squares.
Finally, we add one more absolute value and obtain $||x|-1|+||y|-1| \le 1.$ This will double the squares as we reflect the $2$ squares we already have over the y-axis.
Concluding, we have $4$ congruent squares. Thus, the total area is $4\cdot2 =$ $\boxed{\text{(B) 8}}$

## Solution 2 (Graphing)
We first consider the lattice points that satisfy $||x|-1| = 0$ and $||y|-1| = 1$ . The lattice points satisfying these equations are $(1,0), (1,2), (1,-2), (-1,0), (-1,2),$ and $(-1,-2).$ By symmetry, we also have points $(0,1), (2,1), (-2,1), (0,-1), (2,-1),$ and $(-2,-1)$ when $||x|-1| = 1$ and $||y|-1| = 0$ . Graphing and connecting these points, we form 5 squares. However, we can see that any point within the square in the middle does not satisfy the given inequality (take $(0,0)$ , for instance). As noted in the above solution, each square has a diagonal $2$ for an area of $\frac{2^2}{2} = 2$ , so the total area is $4\cdot2 =$ $\boxed{\text{(B) 8}}.$

## Solution 3 (Logic)
The value of $|x|$ and $|y|$ can be a maximum of 1 when the other is 0. Therefore the value of $x$ and $y$ range from -2 to 2. This forms a diamond shape which has area $4 \times \frac{2^2}{2}$ which is $\boxed{\text{(B) 8}}.$

## Solution 4
We start by considering the graph of $|x|+|y|\leq 1$ . To get from this graph to $||x|-1|+||y|-1| \leq 1$ we have to translate it by $\pm 1$ on the $x$ axis and $\pm 1$ on the $y$ axis.
Graphing $|x|+|y|\leq 1$ we get a square with side length of $\sqrt{2}$ , so the area of one of these squares is just $2$ .
We have to multiply by $4$ since there are $4$ combinations of shifting the $x$ and $y$ axis.
So we have $2\times 4$ which is $\boxed{\text{(B) 8}}$ .

## Solution 5 (Desperate)
There are $2$ sets of $2$ absolute value bars. Each of those $2$ absolute value bars can take on $2$ values, so we have $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ cases. We guess that the answer is divisible by $8$ . The only answer choice that is divisible by $8$ is $\boxed{\text{(B)}~8}$ .
