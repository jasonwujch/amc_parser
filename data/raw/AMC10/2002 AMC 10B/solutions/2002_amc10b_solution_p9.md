# 2002 AMC 10B Problem 9

## Problem

Using the letters $A$ , $M$ , $O$ , $S$ , and $U$ , we can form five-letter "words". If these "words" are arranged in alphabetical order, then the "word" $USAMO$ occupies position

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 112\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 113\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 114\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 115\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 116$

## Solution 1
There are $4!\cdot 4$ "words" beginning with each of the first four letters alphabetically. From there, there are $3!\cdot 3$ with $U$ as the first letter and each of the first three letters alphabetically. After that, the next "word" is $USAMO$ , hence our answer is $4\cdot 4!+3\cdot 3!+1=\boxed{115\Rightarrow\text{(D)}}$ .

## Solution 2
Let $A = 1$ , $M = 2$ , $O = 3$ , $S = 4$ , and $U = 5$ . The ways the numbers can be arranged is $5$ factorial which is $120$ , with $12345$ in spot $1$ and $54321$ in spot $120$ . Then counting backwards, $54321, 54312, 54231, 54213, 54132, 54123$ , so the answer is $\boxed{115\Rightarrow\text{(D)}}$
