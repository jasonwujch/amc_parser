## Problem

For which of the following values of $k$ does the equation $\frac{x-1}{x-2} = \frac{x-k}{x-6}$ have no solution for $x$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 2 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 4 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 5$

## Solution
The domain over which we solve the equation is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{2,6\}$ .
We can now cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions, we get $(x-1)(x-6)=(x-k)(x-2)$ .
Simplifying that, we get $7x-6 = (k+2)x - 2k$ . Clearly for $k=5$ we get the equation $-6=-10$ which is never true. The answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{ (E)}\ 5}$
For other $k$ , one can solve for $x$ : $x(5-k) = 6-2k$ , hence $x=\frac {6-2k}{5-k}$ . We can easily verify that for none of the other 4 possible values of $k$ is this equal to $2$ or $6$ , hence there is a solution for $x$ in each of the other cases.
