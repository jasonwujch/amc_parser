## Problem

For how many positive integers $n$ is $n^2 - 3n + 2$ a prime number?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \text{none} \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one} \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \text{two} \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \text{more\ than\ two,\ but\ finitely\ many} \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{infinitely\ many}$

## Solution 1
Factoring, we get $n^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-2)(n-1)$ . Either $n-1$ or $n-2$ is odd, and the other is even. Their product must yield an even number. The only prime that is even is $2$ , which is when $n$ is $3$ or $0$ . Since $0$ is not a positive number, the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}}$ .

## Solution 2
Considering parity, we see that $n^2 - 3n + 2$ is always even. The only even prime is $2$ , and so $n^2-3n=0$ whence $n=3\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}}$ .

So, in order for this expression to result in a prime number, the result must be 2. You can factor the quadratic equation and eventually see that 3 is the only number satisfying this condition. Hence, the answer is B.
