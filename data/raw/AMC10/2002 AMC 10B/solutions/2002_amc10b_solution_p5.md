# 2002 AMC 10B Problem 5

## Problem

Circles of radius $2$ and $3$ are externally tangent and are circumscribed by a third circle, as shown in the figure. Find the area of the shaded region.

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 3\pi\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 4\pi\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 6\pi\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 9\pi\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 12\pi$

## Solution
A line going through the centers of the two smaller circles also goes through the diameter. The length of this line within the circle is $3+3+2+2=10.$ Because this is the length of the larger circle's diameter, the length of its radius is $5.$
The area of the large circle is $25\pi$ , and the area of the two smaller circles is $9\pi + 4\pi = 13\pi.$ To find the area of the shaded region, subtract the area of the two smaller circles from the area of the large circle. $\longrightarrow 25\pi - 13\pi = \boxed{\mathrm{(E) \ } 12\pi}$
