## Problem

For how many integers $n$ is $\dfrac n{20-n}$ the square of an integer?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 1 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 2 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 3 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 4 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 10$

## Solution 1
Let $x^2 = \frac{n}{20-n}$ , with $x \ge 0$ (note that the solutions $x < 0$ do not give any additional solutions for $n$ ). Then rewriting, $n = \frac{20x^2}{x^2 + 1}$ . Since $\text{gcd}(x^2, x^2 + 1) = 1$ , it follows that $x^2 + 1$ divides $20$ . Listing the factors of $20$ , we find that $x = 0, 1, 2 , 3$ are the only $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 4}$ solutions (respectively yielding $n = 0, 10, 16, 18$ ).

## Solution 2
For $n<0$ and $n>20$ the fraction is negative, for $n=20$ it is not defined, and for $n\in\{1,\dots,9\}$ it is between 0 and 1.
Thus we only need to examine $n=0$ and $n\in\{10,\dots,19\}$ .
For $n=0$ and $n=10$ we obviously get the squares $0$ and $1$ respectively.
For prime $n$ the fraction will not be an integer, as the denominator will not contain the prime in the numerator.
This leaves $n\in\{12,14,15,16,18\}$ , and a quick substitution shows that out of these only $n=16$ and $n=18$ yield a square. Therefore, there are only $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 4}$ solutions (respectively yielding $n = 0, 10, 16, 18$ ).

## Solution 3
If $\frac{n}{20-n} = k^2 \ge 0$ , then $n \ge 0$ and $20-n > 0$ , otherwise $\frac{n}{20-n}$ will be negative. Thus $0 \le n \le 19$ and \[0 = \frac{0}{20-(0)} \le \frac{n}{20-n} \le \frac{19}{20-(19)} = 19\] Checking all $k$ for which $0 \le k^2 \le 19$ , we have $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , $3$ as the possibilities. $\boxed{(D)}$

## Solution 4
For all integers x, $x^2$ is always a positive integer. So solve for $\frac{n}{20-n} = 0$ , getting $n=0$ and $\frac{n}{20-n} = 1$ , getting $n =10$ . For all values n less than 0 and greater than 20, the value $\frac{n}{20-n}$ is negative, so now try values of n between 10 and 20. Quick substitution finds $0$ , $10$ , $16$ , and $18$ which yields $x=0$ , $x=1$ , $x=2$ , and $x=3$ respectively. 4 values, or $\boxed{(D)}$

## Solution 5
Simon's Favourite Factoring Trick.
Since $\frac{n}{20-n}$ is an integer $k$ , we multiply both sides by $20-n$ . This gives us $n=20k^2-nk^2$ . We subtract $20k^2$ on both sides, then add $nk^2$ on both sides as a prerequisite for using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. We have $(k^2+1)(n-20)=20$ . We then consider the different factors of $20$ that $k^2+1$ can be. It could be $1,2,4,5,10$ , and $20$ . After checking case by case, we then are able to identify that there are $4$ such $k$ values that also yield an integer $n$ value, meaning that there are $4$ values, so the correct answer is $\boxed{(D)}$ ~CharmaineMa0729201
