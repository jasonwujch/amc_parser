# 2002 AMC 10B Problem 15

## Problem

The positive integers $A, B, A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers. The sum of these four primes is

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \mathrm{even} \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \mathrm{divisible\ by\ }3 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \mathrm{divisible\ by\ }5 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \mathrm{divisible\ by\ }7 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \mathrm{prime}$

## Solution 1
Since $A-B$ and $A+B$ must have the same parity , and since there is only one even prime number, it follows that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd. Thus one of $A, B$ is odd and the other even. Since $A+B > A > A-B > 2$ , it follows that $A$ (as a prime greater than $2$ ) is odd. Thus $B = 2$ , and $A-2, A, A+2$ are consecutive odd primes. At least one of $A-2, A, A+2$ is divisible by $3$ , from which it follows that $A-2 = 3$ and $A = 5$ . The sum of these numbers is thus $17$ , a prime, so the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{prime}}$ .

## Solution 2
In order for both $A - B$ and $A + B$ to be prime, one of $A, B$ must be 2, or else both $A - B$ , $A + B$ would be even numbers.
If $A = 2$ , then $A < B$ and $A - B < 0$ , which is not possible. Thus $B = 2$ .
Since $A$ is prime and $A > A - B > 2$ , we can infer that $A > 3$ and thus $A$ can be expressed as $6n \pm 1$ for some natural number $n$ .
However in either case, one of $A - B$ and $A + B$ can be expressed as $6n \pm 3 = 3(2n \pm 1)$ which is a multiple of 3. Therefore the only possibility that works is when $A - B = 3$ and \[A + B + (A - B) + (A + B) = 5 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 17\]
Which is a prime number. $\boxed{(E)}$

## Solution 3 (intuitive)
Trying out some primes for $A$ and $B$ such that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime, $A=5$ and $B=2$ can be found almost immediately. Summing the four primes, the result is $5+2+3+7=17$ , which is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{prime}}$ .
