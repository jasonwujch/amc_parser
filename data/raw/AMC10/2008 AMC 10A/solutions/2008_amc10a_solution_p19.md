## Problem

Rectangle $PQRS$ lies in a plane with $PQ=RS=2$ and $QR=SP=6$ . The rectangle is rotated $90^\circ$ clockwise about $R$ , then rotated $90^\circ$ clockwise about the point $S$ moved to after the first rotation. What is the length of the path traveled by point $P$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \left(2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}\right)\pi\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 6\pi\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \left(3+\sqrt{10}\right)\pi\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \left(\sqrt{3}+2\sqrt{5}\right)\pi\\\mathrm{(E)}\ 2\sqrt{10}\pi$

## Solution
We let $P'Q'R'S'$ be the rectangle after the first rotation, and $P''Q''R''S''$ be the rectangle after the second rotation. Point $P$ pivots about $R$ in an arc of a circle of radius $\sqrt{2^2+6^2} = 2\sqrt{10}$ , and since $\angle PRS,\, \angle P'RQ'$ are complementary, it follows that the arc has a degree measure of $90^{\circ}$ and length $\frac14$ of the circumference . Thus, $P$ travels $\frac 14 \left(4\sqrt{10}\right)\pi = \sqrt{10}\pi$ in the first rotation.
Similarly, in the second rotation, $P$ travels in a $90^{\circ}$ arc about $S'$ , with the radius being $6$ . It travels $\frac 14(12)\pi = 3\pi$ . Therefore, the total distance it travels is $\left(3+\sqrt{10}\right)\pi\ \mathrm{(C)}$ .
