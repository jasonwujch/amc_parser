# 2008 AMC 10A Problem 8

## Problem

Heather compares the price of a new computer at two different stores. Store $A$ offers $15\%$ off the sticker price followed by a $\$90$ rebate, and store $B$ offers $25\%$ off the same sticker price with no rebate. Heather saves $\$15$ by buying the computer at store $A$ instead of store $B$ . What is the sticker price of the computer, in dollars?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 750\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 900\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 1000\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 1050\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 1500$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Let the sticker price be $x$ .
The price of the computer is $0.85x-90$ at store $A$ and $0.75x$ at store $B$ .
Heather saves $\$15$ at store $A$ , so $0.85x-90+15=0.75x$ .
Solving, we find $x=750$ , and thus the answer is $\mathrm{(A)}$ .

## Solution 2
The $\$ 90$ at store $A$ is $\$ 15$ greater than the additional $25\%-15\% = 10\%$ off at store $B$ .
Thus the $10\%$ off is equal to $\$ 90$ $-$ $\$ 15$ $=$ $\$ 75$ , and therefore the sticker price is $\$ 750$ .
