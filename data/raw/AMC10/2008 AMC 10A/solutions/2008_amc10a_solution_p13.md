# 2008 AMC 10A Problem 13

## Problem

Doug can paint a room in $5$ hours. Dave can paint the same room in $7$ hours. Doug and Dave paint the room together and take a one-hour break for lunch. Let $t$ be the total time, in hours, required for them to complete the job working together, including lunch. Which of the following equations is satisfied by $t$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}\right)\left(t+1\right)=1\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}\right)t+1=1\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}\right)t=1\\\mathrm{(D)}\ \left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}\right)\left(t-1\right)=1\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \left(5+7\right)t=1$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Doug can paint $\frac{1}{5}$ of a room per hour, Dave can paint $\frac{1}{7}$ of a room per hour, and the time they spend working together is $t-1$ .
Since rate multiplied by time gives output, $\left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}\right)\left(t-1\right)=1 \Rightarrow \mathrm{(D)}$

## Solution 2
If one person does a job in $a$ hours and another person does a job in $b$ hours, the time it takes to do the job together is $\frac{ab}{a+b}$ hours.
Since Doug paints a room in 5 hours and Dave paints a room in 7 hours, they both paint in $\frac{5\times7}{5+7} = \frac{35}{12}$ hours. They also take 1 hour for lunch, so the total time $t = \frac{35}{12} + 1$ hours.
Looking at the answer choices, $(D)$ is the only one satisfied by $t = \frac{35}{12} + 1$ .
