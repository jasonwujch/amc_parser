## Problem

An equilateral triangle has side length $6$ . What is the area of the region containing all points that are outside the triangle but not more than $3$ units from a point of the triangle?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 36+24\sqrt{3}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 54+9\pi\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 54+18\sqrt{3}+6\pi\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \left(2\sqrt{3}+3\right)^2\pi\\\mathrm{(E)}\ 9\left(\sqrt{3}+1\right)^2\pi$

## Solution 1
The region described contains three rectangles of dimensions $3 \times 6$ , and three $120^{\circ}$ degree arcs of circles of radius $3$ . Thus the answer is \[3(3 \times 6) + 3 \left( \frac{120^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}} \times 3^2 \pi\right) = 54 + 9\pi \Longrightarrow \mathrm{(B)}.\]

## Solution 2
After a quick sketch of the problem, one can deduce that there are $3$ rectangles in the figure, each with side length $6$ and width $3$ . Therefore, the combined areas of the rectangles is $54$ . The other three regions are circle-shaped areas, probably expressed in some form of $\pi$ . Answer choices $\mathrm{(A)}$ , $\mathrm{(D)}$ , $\mathrm{(E)}$ are impossible because they either lack an integer or $\pi$ in the answer, and $\mathrm{(C)}$ is impossible since $18\sqrt{3}$ clearly does not belong to the rectangle or the circular areas. We can conclude that the only choice left is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}}$ .
