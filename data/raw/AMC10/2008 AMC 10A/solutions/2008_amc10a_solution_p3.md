# 2008 AMC 10A Problem 3

## Problem

For the positive integer $n$ , let $\langle n\rangle$ denote the sum of all the positive divisors of $n$ with the exception of $n$ itself. For example, $\langle 4\rangle=1+2=3$ and $\langle 12 \rangle =1+2+3+4+6=16$ . What is $\langle\langle\langle 6\rangle\rangle\rangle$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 6\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 12\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 24\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 32\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 36$

## Solution 1
$\langle\langle\langle 6\rangle\rangle\rangle= \langle\langle 6\rangle\rangle = \langle 6\rangle=\ 6\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\mathrm{(A)}$

## Solution 2
Since $6$ is a perfect number, any such operation where $n=6$ will yield $6$ as the answer.
Note: A perfect number is defined as a number that equals the sum of its positive divisors excluding itself.
