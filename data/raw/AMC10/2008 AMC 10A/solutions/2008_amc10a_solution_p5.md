# 2008 AMC 10A Problem 5

## Problem

Which of the following is equal to the product \[\frac{8}{4}\cdot\frac{12}{8}\cdot\frac{16}{12}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{4n+4}{4n}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{2008}{2004}?\]

$\textbf{(A)}\ 251\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 502\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 1004\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 2008\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 4016$

## Solution 1
$\frac {8}{4}\cdot\frac {12}{8}\cdot\frac {16}{12}\cdots\frac {4n + 4}{4n}\cdots\frac {2008}{2004} = \frac {1}{4}\cdot\left(\frac {8}{8}\cdot\frac {12}{12}\cdots\frac {4n}{4n}\cdots\frac {2004}{2004}\right)\cdot 2008 = \frac{2008}{4} =$ $502 \Rightarrow B$ .

## Solution 2
Notice that everything cancels out except for $2008$ in the numerator and $4$ in the denominator.
Thus, the product is $\frac{2008}{4}=502$ , and the answer is $\textbf{(B)}$ .
