## Problem

For real numbers $x$ and $y$ , define $x \spadesuit y = (x+y)(x-y)$ . What is $3 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 5)$ ?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } -72\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } -27\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } -24\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 24\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 72$

## Solution 1
Since $x \spadesuit y = (x+y)(x-y)$ :
$3 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 5) = 3 \spadesuit((4+5)(4-5)) = 3 \spadesuit (-9) = (3+(-9))(3-(-9)) = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}-72}$

## Solution 2
From difference of squares , we have $x \spadesuit y = (x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2$
So:
$3 \spadesuit (4 \spadesuit 5) = 3 \spadesuit(4^2 - 5^2) = 3 \spadesuit (16 - 25) = 3 \spadesuit (-9)= (3^2) - (-9)^2 = 9 - 81 = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}-72}$
