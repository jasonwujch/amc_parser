# 2006 AMC 10B Problem 5

## Problem

A $2 \times 3$ rectangle and a $3 \times 4$ rectangle are contained within a square without overlapping at any point, and the sides of the square are parallel to the sides of the two given rectangles. What is the smallest possible area of the square?

$\textbf{(A) } 16\qquad \textbf{(B) } 25\qquad \textbf{(C) } 36\qquad \textbf{(D) } 49\qquad \textbf{(E) } 64$

## Solution 1
By placing the $2 \times 3$ rectangle adjacent to the $3 \times 4$ rectangle with the 3 side of the $2 \times 3$ rectangle next to the 4 side of the $3 \times 4$ rectangle, we get a figure that can be completely enclosed in a square with a side length of 5. The area of this square is $5^2 = 25$ .
Since placing the two rectangles inside a $4 \times 4$ square must result in overlap, the smallest possible area of the square is $25$ .
So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }25}$ .

## Solution 2
The area of a $2\times3$ rectangle and a $3\times4$ rectangle combined is $18$ , so a $4\times4$ square is impossible without overlapping. Thus, the next smallest square is a $5\times5$ , which works, so the answer is $\boxed{B)25}$ .
Note: If you do this, always check to see if it fits, because this doesn't always work. For example, a $3\times3$ and a $3\times4$ doesn't fit into a $5\times5$ , even though their combined area is $21$ .
