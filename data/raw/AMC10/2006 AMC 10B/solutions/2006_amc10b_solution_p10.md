## Problem

In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second side, and the length of the third side is $15$ . What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?

$\textbf{(A) } 43\qquad \textbf{(B) } 44\qquad \textbf{(C) } 45\qquad \textbf{(D) } 46\qquad \textbf{(E) } 47$

## Solution
Let $x$ be the length of the first side.
The lengths of the sides are: $x$ , $3x$ , and $15$ .
By the Triangle Inequality ,
$3x < x + 15$
$2x < 15$
$x < \frac{15}{2}$
The greatest integer satisfying this inequality is $7$ .
So the greatest possible perimeter is $7 + 3\cdot7 + 15 =\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 43}$
