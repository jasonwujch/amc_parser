## Problem

Elmo makes $N$ sandwiches for a fundraiser. For each sandwich he uses $B$ globs of peanut butter at $4\cent$ per glob and $J$ blobs of jam at $5\cent$ per blob. The cost of the peanut butter and jam to make all the sandwiches is $\$ 2.53$ . Assume that $B$ , $J$ , and $N$ are positive integers with $N>1$ . What is the cost of the jam Elmo uses to make the sandwiches?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } \$ 1.05\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } \$ 1.25\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } \$ 1.45\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } \$ 1.65\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } \$ 1.85$

## Solution 1
The peanut butter and jam for each sandwich costs $4B\cent+5J\cent$ , so the peanut butter and jam for $N$ sandwiches costs $N(4B+5J)\cent$ .
Setting this equal to $253\cent$ :
$N(4B+5J)=253=11\cdot23$
The only possible positive integer pairs $(N , 4B+5J)$ whose product is $253$ are: $(1,253) ; (11,23) ; (23,11) ; (253,1)$
The first pair violates $N>1$ and the third and fourth pairs have no positive integer solutions for $B$ and $J$ .
So, $N=11$ and $4B+5J=23$ .
The only integer solutions for $B$ and $J$ are $B=2$ and $J=3$ .
Therefore, the cost of the jam Elmo uses to make the sandwiches is $3\cdot5\cdot11=165\cent$ $= \$1.65 \Rightarrow \boxed{\mathrm{D}}$

## Solution 2
Note as above, you get the equation $N(0.04B+0.05J)=2.53$
Notice that we can multiply by $100$ on both sides to get whole numbers. Hence $\implies N(4B+5J)=253$
Note that the prime factorization of $253=11\cdot23$ .
Hence, we want $4B+5J=23$ or $11$
Now, we have two cases to test.
Case 1: $4B+5J=23$
Notice that we want $B\le5$ or $J\le4$
Taking $\pmod{5}\implies 4B\equiv3\pmod{5}\implies B=2$
Hence, $B=2,J=3$ .
Hence, the price of the jam is $3\cdot11\cdot{0.05}\implies 1.65 \implies\boxed{D}$ .
