# 2010 AMC 10A Problem 10

## Problem

Marvin had a birthday on Tuesday, May 27 in the leap year $2008$ . In what year will his birthday next fall on a Saturday?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 2011 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 2012 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 2013 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 2015 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 2017$

## Solution
There are $365$ days in a non-leap year. There are $7$ days in a week. Since $365 = 52 \cdot 7 + 1$ (or $365\equiv 1 \pmod{ 7}$ ), the same date (after February) moves "forward" one day in the subsequent year, if that year is not a leap year.
For example:
$5/27/08$ Tue
$5/27/09$ Wed
However, a leap year has $366$ days, and $366 = 52 \cdot 7 + 2$ . So the same date (after February) moves "forward" two days in the subsequent year, if that year is a leap year.
For example: $5/27/11$ Fri
$5/27/12$ Sun
You can keep counting forward to find that the first time this date falls on a Saturday is in $2017$ :
$5/27/13$ Mon
$5/27/14$ Tue
$5/27/15$ Wed
$5/27/16$ Fri
$5/27/17$ Sat
$\boxed{(E) 2017}$
