## Problem

Mary's top book shelf holds five books with the following widths, in centimeters: $6$ , $\dfrac{1}{2}$ , $1$ , $2.5$ , and $10$ . What is the average book width, in centimeters?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 3 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 4 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution
To find the average, we add up the widths $6$ , $\dfrac{1}{2}$ , $1$ , $2.5$ , and $10$ , to get a total sum of $20$ . Since there are $5$ books, the average book width is $\frac{20}{5}=4$ The answer is $\boxed{D}$ .
