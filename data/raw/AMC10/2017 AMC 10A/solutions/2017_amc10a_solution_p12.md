# 2017 AMC 10A Problem 12

## Problem

Let $S$ be a set of points $(x,y)$ in the coordinate plane such that two of the three quantities $3,~x+2,$ and $y-4$ are equal and the third of the three quantities is no greater than this common value. Which of the following is a correct description for $S?$

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{a single point} \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \text{two intersecting lines} \\\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \text{three lines whose pairwise intersections are three distinct points} \\\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \text{a triangle} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \text{three rays with a common endpoint}$

## Solution 1
If the two equal values are $3$ and $x+2$ , then $x=1$ . Also, $y-4\le 3$ because $3$ is the common value. Solving for $y$ , we get $y \le 7$ . Therefore the portion of the line $x=1$ where $y \le 7$ is part of $S$ . This is a ray with an endpoint of $(1, 7)$ .
Similar to the process above, we assume that the two equal values are $3$ and $y-4$ . Solving the equation $3=y-4$ then $y=7$ . Also, $x+2\le 3$ because 3 is the common value. Solving for $x$ , we get $x\le1$ . Therefore the portion of the line $y=7$ where $x\le 1$ is also part of $S$ . This is another ray with the same endpoint as the above ray: $(1, 7)$ .
If $x+2$ and $y-4$ are the two equal values, then $x+2=y-4$ . Solving the equation for $y$ , we get $y=x+6$ . Also $3\le y-4$ because $y-4$ is one way to express the common value. Solving for $y$ , we get $y\ge 7$ . We also know $3\le x+2$ , so $x\ge 1$ .Therefore the portion of the line $y=x+6$ where $y\ge 7$ is part of $S$ like the other two rays. The lowest possible value that can be achieved is also $(1, 7)$ .
Since $S$ is made up of three rays with common endpoint $(1, 7)$ , the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\text{three rays with a common endpoint}}$

## Solution 2 (Graphing \(S\))
Similar to above, we make three equations.
\( 3 = x + 2 \)
\( 3 = y - 4 \)
\( x + 2 = y - 4 \)
and solve them in terms of a linear equation
\( x = 1 \)
\( y = 7 \)
\( x + 6 = y \)
We proceed to graph each of the three equations.
We now see that no third value is less than the common point. Therefore, we want the overlapping region of \( y \ge 7 \) and \( x \ge 1 \).
There are three lines in this region that start at a point \((1, 7)\). A line that extends forever starting at any point is called a ray. Because we have three of these lines, particularly \( x = 1 \), \( y = 7 \), and \( x + 6 = y \), we have $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\text{three rays with a common endpoint}}$ .
