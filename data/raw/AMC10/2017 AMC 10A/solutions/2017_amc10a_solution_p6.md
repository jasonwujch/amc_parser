# 2017 AMC 10A Problem 6

## Problem

Ms. Carroll promised that anyone who got all the multiple choice questions right on the upcoming exam would receive an A on the exam. Which one of these statements necessarily follows logically?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{If Lewis did not receive an A, then he got all of the multiple choice questions wrong.}\\\textbf{(B)}\ \text{If Lewis did not receive an A, then he got at least one of the multiple choice questions wrong.}\\\textbf{(C)}\ \text{If Lewis got at least one of the multiple choice questions wrong, then he did not receive an A. }\\\textbf{(D)}\ \text{If Lewis received an A, then he got all of the multiple choice questions right.}\\\textbf{(E)}\ \text{If Lewis received an A, then he got at least one of the multiple choice questions right.}$

## Solution 1 (Using the Contrapositive)
Rewriting the given statement: "if someone got all the multiple choice questions right on the upcoming exam then he or she would receive an A on the exam." If that someone is Lewis the statement becomes: "if Lewis got all the multiple choice questions right, then he would receive an A on the exam."
The contrapositive: "If Lewis did not receive an A, then he did not get all of them right"
The contrapositive (in other words): "If Lewis did not get an A, then he got at least one of the multiple choice questions wrong".
B is also equivalent to the contrapositive of the original statement, which implies that it must be true, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\text{ If Lewis did not receive an A, then he got at least one of the multiple choice questions wrong.}}$ .
- Note that answer choice (B) is the contrapositive of the given statement. (That is, it has been negated as well as reversed.) We know that the contrapositive is always true if the given statement is true.

## Solution 2 (Elimination)
Note: An A is usually 90%-100% of the questions correct.
$\textbf{(A)}$ False. If Lewis did not receive an A, that does not mean he got all the multiple-choice questions wrong. For example, he might get 19/20 or 18/20, which still accounts for an A.
$\textbf{(B)}$ True. If Lewis did not receive an A, then he must have got at least one wrong. Otherwise, Lewis would have gotten an A.
$\textbf{(C)}$ False. Again, Lewis can get 19/20 or 18/20, which is still an A.
$\textbf{(D)}$ False. The above situation can happen.
$\textbf{(E)}$ False. Lewis can get 17/20 or less but it is not an A.
Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}.$
