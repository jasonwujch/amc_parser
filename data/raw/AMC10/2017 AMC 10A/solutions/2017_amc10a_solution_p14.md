# 2017 AMC 10A Problem 14

## Problem

Every week Roger pays for a movie ticket and a soda out of his allowance. Last week, Roger's allowance was $A$ dollars. The cost of his movie ticket was $20\%$ of the difference between $A$ and the cost of his soda, while the cost of his soda was $5\%$ of the difference between $A$ and the cost of his movie ticket. To the nearest whole percent, what fraction of $A$ did Roger pay for his movie ticket and soda?

$\textbf{(A) } 9\%\qquad \textbf{(B) } 19\%\qquad \textbf{(C) } 22\%\qquad \textbf{(D) } 23\%\qquad \textbf{(E) } 25\%$

## Solution
Let $m$ = cost of movie ticket Let $s$ = cost of soda
We can create two equations:
\[m = \frac{1}{5}(A - s)\] \[s = \frac{1}{20}(A - m)\]
Substituting we get:
\[m = \frac{1}{5}(A - \frac{1}{20}(A - m))\] which yields: \[m = \frac{19}{99}A\]
Now we can find s and we get:
\[s = \frac{4}{99}A\]
Since we want to find what fraction of $A$ did Roger pay for his movie ticket and soda, we add $m$ and $s$ to get:
\[\frac{19}{99}A + \frac{4}{99}A \implies \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 23\%}\]

## Solution 2
We have two equations from the problem: $5M=A-S$ and $20S=A-M$ If we replace $A$ with $100$ we get a system of equations, and the sum of the values of $M$ and $S$ is the percentage of $A$ . Solving, we get $S=\frac{400}{99}$ and $M=\frac{1900}{99}$ . Adding, we get $\frac{2300}{99}$ , which is closest to $23$ which is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 23\%}$ .

## Solution 3
Let $m$ be the price of a movie ticket and $s$ be the price of a soda.
Then,
\[m=\frac{A-s}{5}\] and \[s=\frac{A-m}{20}\] Then, we can turn this into \[5m=A-s\] \[20s=A-m\]
Subtracting and getting rid of A, we have $20s-5m=-m+s \rightarrow 19s=4m$ . Assuming WLOG (without loss of generality) that $s=4$ , $m=19$ , thus making a solution for this equation. Substituting this into the 1st equation, we get $A=99$ . Hence, $\frac{m+s}{A} = \frac{19+4}{99} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 23\%}$
