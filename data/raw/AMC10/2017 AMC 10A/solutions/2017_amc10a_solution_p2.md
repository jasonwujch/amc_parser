## Problem

Pablo buys popsicles for his friends. The store sells single popsicles for $\$1$ each, $3$ -popsicle boxes for $\$2$ each, and $5$ -popsicle boxes for $\$3$ . What is the greatest number of popsicles that Pablo can buy with $\$8$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 11\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 13\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution 1
$\$3$ boxes give us the most popsicles/dollar, so we want to buy as many of those as possible. After buying $2$ , we have $\$2$ left. We cannot buy a third $\$3$ box, so we opt for the $\$2$ box instead (since it has a higher popsicles/dollar ratio than the $\$1$ pack). We're now out of money. We bought $5+5+3=13$ popsicles, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }13}$ .
