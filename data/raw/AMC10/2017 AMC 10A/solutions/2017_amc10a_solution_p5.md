## Problem

The sum of two nonzero real numbers is $4$ times their product. What is the sum of the reciprocals of the two numbers?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 12$

## Solution
Let the two real numbers be $x,y$ . We are given that $x+y=4xy,$ and dividing both sides by $xy$ , $\frac{x}{xy}+\frac{y}{xy}=4.$
\[\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{x}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 4}.\]
Note: we can easily verify that this is the correct answer; for example, $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ works, and the sum of their reciprocals is $4$ .

## Solution 2
Instead of using algebra, another approach at this problem would be to notice the fact that one of the nonzero numbers has to be a fraction. See for yourself. And by looking into fractions, we immediately see that $\frac{1}{3}$ and $1$ would fit the rule. $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} 4}.$

## Solution 3
Notice that from the information given above, $x+y=4xy$
Because the sum of the reciprocals of two numbers is just the sum of the two numbers over the product of the two numbers or $\frac{x+y}{xy}$
We can solve this by substituting $x+y\implies 4xy$ .
Our answer is simply $\frac{4xy}{xy}\implies4$ .
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 4}$ .
