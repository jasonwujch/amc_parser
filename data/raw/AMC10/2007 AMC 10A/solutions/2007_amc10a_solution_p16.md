# 2007 AMC 10A Problem 16

## Problem

Integers $a, b, c,$ and $d$ , not necessarily distinct, are chosen independently and at random from 0 to 2007, inclusive. What is the probability that $ad-bc$ is even ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac 38\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ \frac 7{16}\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ \frac 12\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ \frac 9{16}\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ \frac 58$

## Solution 1
The only time when $ad-bc$ is even is when $ad$ and $bc$ are of the same parity . The chance of $ad$ being odd is $\frac 12 \cdot \frac 12 = \frac 14$ , since the only way to have $ad$ be odd is to have both $a$ and $d$ be odd. As a result, $ad$ has a $\frac 34$ probability of being even. $bc$ also has a $\frac 14$ chance of being odd and a $\frac34$ chance of being even. Therefore, the probability that $ad-bc$ will be even is $\left(\frac 14\right)^2+\left(\frac 34\right)^2=\boxed {\mathrm{(E )} \frac 58\ }$ .

## Solution 2 (casework)
If we don't know our parity rules, we can check and see that $ad-bc$ is only even when $ad$ and $bc$ are of the same parity (as stated above). From here, we have two cases.
Case 1: $odd-odd$ (which must be $o \cdot o-o \cdot o$ ). The probability for this to occur is $\left(\frac 12\right)^4 = \frac 1{16}$ , because each integer has a $\frac 12$ chance of being odd.
Case 2: $even-even$ (which occurs in 4 cases: $(e \cdot e-e \cdot e$ ), ( $o \cdot e-o \cdot e$ ) (alternating of any kind), and ( $e \cdot e-o \cdot e$ ) with its reverse, ( $o \cdot e-e \cdot e$ ).
Our first subcase of case 2 has a chance of $\frac 1{16}$ (same reasoning as above).
Our second subcase of case 2 has a $\frac 14$ chance, since only the 2nd and 4th flip matter (or 1st and 3rd).
Our third subcase of case 2 has a $\frac 18$ chance, because the 1st, 2nd, and either 3rd or 4th flip matter.
Our fourth subcase of case 2 has a $\frac 18$ chance, because it's the same, just reversed.
We sum these, and get our answer of $\frac 1{16} + \frac 1{16} + \frac 14 + \frac 18 + \frac 18 = \boxed {\mathrm{(E )} \frac 58\ }.$
