# 2007 AMC 10A Problem 5

## Problem

The school store sells 7 pencils and 8 notebooks for $\mathdollar 4.15$ . It also sells 5 pencils and 3 notebooks for $\mathdollar 1.77$ . How much do 16 pencils and 10 notebooks cost?

$\text{(A)}\mathdollar 1.76 \qquad \text{(B)}\mathdollar 5.84 \qquad \text{(C)}\mathdollar 6.00 \qquad \text{(D)}\mathdollar 6.16 \qquad \text{(E)}\mathdollar 6.32$

## Solution
Let $p$ be cost of one pencil in dollars and $n$ the cost of one notebook in dollars. Then
\begin{align*} 7p + 8n = 4.15 &\implies 35p + 40n = 20.75\\ 5p + 3n = 1.77 &\implies 35p + 21n = 12.39 \end{align*}
Subtracting these equations yields $19n = 8.36 \Longrightarrow n = 0.44$ . Solving backwards gives $p = 0.09$ . Thus the answer is $16p + 10n = \text{(B)}\mathdollar 5.84$ .

## Solution 2
Since 5 pencils and 3 notebooks cost 1.77 dollars, then 3 times that or 15 pencils and 9 notebooks costs 5.31 dollars which is 1 pencil and 1 notebook off. Looking at answer choices, it can only be 5.84 so $\mathrm{(B)}$ .
Note: 6.00 dollars would imply that 1 pencil and 1 notebook would cost more than 30% of 5 pencils and 3 notebooks, which is incorrect.
