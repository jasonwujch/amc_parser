## Problem

An aquarium has a rectangular base that measures $100$ cm by $40$ cm and has a height of $50$ cm. It is filled with water to a height of $40$ cm. A brick with a rectangular base that measures $40$ cm by $20$ cm and a height of $10$ cm is placed in the aquarium. By how many centimeters does the water rise?

$\text{(A)}\ 0.5 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 1 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 1.5 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 2 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 2.5$

## Solution
The volume of the brick is $40 \times 20 \times 10 = 8000$ . Thus the water volume rose $8000 = 100 \times 40 \times h \Longrightarrow h = 2\ \mathrm{(D)}$ .
