## Problem

The larger of two consecutive odd integers is three times the smaller. What is their sum?

$\text{(A)}\ 4 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 8 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 12 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 16 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 20$

## Solution
Let the two consecutive odd integers be $a$ , $a+2$ . Then $a+2 = 3a$ , so $a = 1, a + 2 = 3$ and their sum is $4\ \mathrm{(A)}$ .
