## Problem

The Dunbar family consists of a mother, a father, and some children. The average age of the members of the family is $20$ , the father is $48$ years old, and the average age of the mother and children is $16$ . How many children are in the family?

$\text{(A)}\ 2 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 3 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 4 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 5 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 6$

## Solution 1
Let $n$ be the number of children. Then the total ages of the family is $48 + 16(n+1)$ , and the total number of people in the family is $n+2$ . So
\[20 = \frac{48 + 16(n+1)}{n+2} \Longrightarrow 20n + 40 = 16n + 64 \Longrightarrow n = 6\ \mathrm{(E)}.\]

## Solution 2
Let $x$ be the number of the children and the mom. The father, who is $48$ , plus the sum of the ages of the kids and mom divided by the number of kids and mom plus $1$ (for the dad) = $20$ . This is because the average age of the entire family is $20.$ This statement, written as an equation, is: \[\frac{48+16x}{x+1}=20\] \[48+16x=20x+20\] \[4x=28\] \[x=7\]
$7$ people - $1$ mom = $6$ children.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{E}$

## Solution 3
Let $m$ be the Mom's age.
Let the number of children be $x$ and their average age be $y$ . Their age totaled up is simply $xy$ .
We have the following two equations:
$\frac{m+48+xy}{2+x}=20$ , where $m+48+xy$ is the family's total age and $2+x$ is the total number of people in the family.
$\frac{m+48+xy}{2+x}=20$
$m+48+xy=40+20x$
The next equation is $\frac{m+xy}{1+x}=16$ , where $m+xy$ is the total age of the Mom and the children, and $1+x$ is the number of children along with the Mom.
$\frac{m+xy}{1+x}=16$
$m+xy=16+16x$ .
We know the value for $m+xy$ , so we substitute the value back in the first equation.
$m+48+xy=40+20x$
$(16+16x)+48=40+20x$ .
$x=6$ .
Earlier, we set $x$ to be the number of children. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\text{(E)} 6}$ children.
