## Problem

Define $a@b = ab - b^{2}$ and $a\#b = a + b - ab^{2}$ . What is $\frac {6@2}{6\#2}$ ?

$\text{(A)}\ - \frac {1}{2}\qquad \text{(B)}\ - \frac {1}{4}\qquad \text{(C)}\ \frac {1}{8}\qquad \text{(D)}\ \frac {1}{4}\qquad \text{(E)}\ \frac {1}{2}$

## Solution
$6@2$ must be equal to $6*2-2^2$ which is 8. $6\# 2$ is equal to $6+2-6*2^2$ which is $8-24 = -16$ . Therefore $\frac{6@2}{6\# 2}$ must be equal to $\frac{8}{-16} = -\frac{1}{2}$ . Therefore the solution is $A$ .
