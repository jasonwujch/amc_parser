## Problem

Real numbers $a$ and $b$ satisfy the equations $3^{a} = 81^{b + 2}$ and $125^{b} = 5^{a - 3}$ . What is $ab$ ?

$\text{(A)}\ -60 \qquad \text{(B)}\ -17 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 9 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 12 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 60$

## Solution 1
\[81^{b+2} = 3^{4(b+2)} = 3^a \Longrightarrow a = 4b+8\]
And
\[125^{b} = 5^{3b} = 5^{a-3} \Longrightarrow a - 3 = 3b\]
Substitution gives $4b+8 - 3 = 3b \Longrightarrow b = -5$ , and solving for $a$ yields $-12$ . Thus $ab = 60\ \mathrm{(E)}$ .

## Solution 1 another similar way
Simplify equation $1$ , which is $3^a=81^{b+2}$ , to $3^a=3^{4b+8}$ .
And
Simplify equation $2$ , which is $125^b=5^{a-3}$ , to $5^{3b}=5^{a-3}$ .
Now, eliminate the bases from the simplified equations $1$ and $2$ to arrive at $a=4b+8$ and $3b=a-3$ . Rewrite equation $2$ so that it is in terms of $a$ . That would be $a=3b+3$ .
Since both equations are equal to $a$ , and the values for $a$ and $b$ are constant for both equations, set the equations equal to each other. $4b+8=3b+3 \Longrightarrow b=-5$
Now plug $b$ , which is $-5$ , back into one of the two earlier equations. $4(-5)+8=a \Longrightarrow -20+8=a \Longrightarrow a=-12$
$(-12)(-5)=60$
Therefore the correct answer is $\mathrm{(E)}$
