# 2007 AMC 10A Problem 7

## Problem

Last year Mr. Jon Q. Public received an inheritance. He paid $20\%$ in federal taxes on the inheritance, and paid $10\%$ of what he had left in state taxes. He paid a total of $\textdollar10500$ for both taxes. How many dollars was his inheritance?

$(\mathrm {A})\ 30000 \qquad (\mathrm {B})\ 32500 \qquad(\mathrm {C})\ 35000 \qquad(\mathrm {D})\ 37500 \qquad(\mathrm {E})\ 40000$

## Solution 1
After paying his taxes, he has $0.8*0.9=0.72$ of his earnings left. Since $10500$ is $0.28$ of his income, he got a total of $\frac{10500}{0.28}=37500\ \mathrm{(D)}$ .

## Solution 2
Let his total inheritance be a number $x$ . The amount of tax he has to pay at first can be represented as $0.2x$ . The amount of money he has left over after this expense can be written as $0.8x$ . He then has to pay $10\%$ tax on this remaining amount, which can be written as $0.1(0.8x) = 0.08x$ . The combined expense of these taxes is $10500$ , so $0.2x + 0.08x = 10500 \Longrightarrow 0.28x = 10500$ . Therefore $x = \frac{10500}{0.28}\ = 37500 \mathrm{(D)}$ .
