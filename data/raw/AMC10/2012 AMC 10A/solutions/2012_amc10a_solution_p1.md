# 2012 AMC 10A Problem 1

## Problem

Cagney can frost a cupcake every 20 seconds and Lacey can frost a cupcake every 30 seconds. Working together, how many cupcakes can they frost in 5 minutes?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 25\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 30$

## Solution 1
Cagney can frost one in $20$ seconds, and Lacey can frost one in $30$ seconds. Working together, they can frost one in $\frac{20\cdot30}{20+30} = \frac{600}{50} = 12$ seconds. In $300$ seconds ( $5$ minutes), they can frost $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 25}$ cupcakes.

## Solution 2
In $300$ seconds ( $5$ minutes), Cagney will frost $\dfrac{300}{20} = 15$ cupcakes, and Lacey will frost $\dfrac{300}{30} = 10$ cupcakes. Therefore, working together they will frost $15 + 10 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 25}$ cupcakes.

## Solution 3
Since Cagney frosts $3$ cupcakes a minute, and Lacey frosts $2$ cupcakes a minute, they together frost $3+2=5$ cupcakes a minute. Therefore, in $5$ minutes, they frost $5\times5 = 25 \Rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$
