# 2012 AMC 10A Problem 6

## Problem

The product of two positive numbers is 9. The reciprocal of one of these numbers is 4 times the reciprocal of the other number. What is the sum of the two numbers?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{10}{3}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{20}{3}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 7\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{15}{2}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 8$

## Solution
Let the two numbers equal $x$ and $y$ . From the information given in the problem, two equations can be written:
$xy=9$
$\frac{1}{x}=4 \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)$
Therefore, $4x=y$
Replacing $y$ with $4x$ in the equation,
$4x^2=9$
So $x=\frac{3}{2}$ and $y$ would then be $4 \times$ $\frac{3}{2}=6$
The sum would be $\frac{3}{2}+6$ = $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{15}{2}}$

## Solution 2
Set up your first equation which is $xy=9$ and your second being $\dfrac{1}{x} = \dfrac4y$ . Then, in the first equation, rearrange it to become $x=\dfrac9y$ . Now plug this in to your second equation, and you should get $\dfrac{y}{9}=\dfrac{4}{y}$ . Cross multiply to get $y^2=36$ , and simplify to get $y=6$ . Notice how the problem mentioned that they were positive integers, so we don't consider $-6$ . We plug $6$ back into our first equation to get $6x=9$ which makes $x$ come out to be $1.5$ . We add $x+y=6+1.5=7.5$ . Notice answer choice $D$ is the only fraction that simplifies to $1.5$ , so answer option $\boxed{D}$ must be the answer.
