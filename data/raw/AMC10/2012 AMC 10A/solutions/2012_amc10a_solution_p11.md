## Problem

Externally tangent circles with centers at points $A$ and $B$ have radii of lengths $5$ and $3$ , respectively. A line externally tangent to both circles intersects ray $AB$ at point $C$ . What is $BC$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 4.8\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 10.2\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 14.4$

## Solution
Let $D$ and $E$ be the points of tangency on circles $A$ and $B$ with line $CD$ . $AB=8$ . Also, let $BC=x$ . As $\angle ADC$ and $\angle BEC$ are right angles (a radius is perpendicular to a tangent line at the point of tangency) and both triangles share $\angle ACD$ , $\triangle ADC \sim \triangle BEC$ . From this we can get a proportion.
$\frac{BC}{AC}=\frac{BE}{AD} \rightarrow \frac{x}{x+8}=\frac{3}{5} \rightarrow 5x=3x+24 \rightarrow x=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 12}$
