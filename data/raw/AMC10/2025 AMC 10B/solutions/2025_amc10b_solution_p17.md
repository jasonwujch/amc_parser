# 2025 AMC 10B Problem 17

## Problem

Consider a decreasing sequence of \(n\) positive integers \[x_1 > x_2 > \cdots > x_n\] that satisfies the following conditions:

- The average of the first \(3\) terms in the sequence is \(2025\).

- For all \(4 \le k \le n\), the average of the first \(k\) terms is \(1\) less than the average of the first \(k-1\) terms.

What is the greatest possible value of \(n\)?

$\textbf{(A)}~1013 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~1014 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~1016 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~2016 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~2025$

## Solution 1
Since the mean of the first three terms is $2025$ , their sum is $2025 * 3 = 6075$ . Then, incorporating the fourth term makes the mean $2025-1=2024$ , so their sum must be
$2024 * 4 = 8096$ , implying that the 4th term is $8096-6075=2021$ Doing the same for the 5th term,
$2023 * 5= 10115$ , 5th term is
$10115-8096=2019$
Algebraically, we can model this pattern for the $k$ th term = x as
$(k-1)(2029-k) + x = (k)(2028-k)$
$2029k-2029-k^2+k+x=2028k-k^2$
$x=2029-2k$
So the maximum $k\le n$ for which $x$ is positive is 1014, giving our answer $n=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }1014}$

## Solution 2
The average of the first 3 terms in the sequence is 2025, which means \[\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} = 2025,\] so $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6075$ .
For $k = 4$ , we have \[\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{4} = 2025 - 1 = 2024,\] so $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8096$ . We know $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6075$ , so \[x_4 = 8096 - 6075 = 2021.\]
For $k = 5$ , we have \[\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5}{5} = 2024 - 1 = 2023.\] That means $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 10115$ . We know $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8096$ , so \[x_5 = 10115 - 8096 = 2019.\]
Continuing on for $k = 6, 7, 8, \ldots$ , we can see that each term decreases by 2. So, \[x_6 = 2017,\ x_7 = 2015,\ x_8 = 2013,\ \text{and likewise,}\ x_3 = 2023,\ x_2 = 2025,\ x_1 = 2027.\]
To find the greatest possible value of $n$ , we need to find when the numbers in this sequence become negative. The general term is \[x_n = 2027 - 2(n-1).\] We require $x_n > 0$ , so \[2027 - 2(n-1) > 0.\] This simplifies to \[2027 > 2n - 2 \Rightarrow 2029 > 2n \Rightarrow n < 1014.5.\]
Thus the greatest possible integer value of $n$ is $1014$ , so the answer is $\text{(B) } 1014$ . ~anzhuPro

## Solution 3
Assume that the first three terms are $2026$ , $2025$ , and $2024$ , respectively. The average of the first four terms is $2025-1=2024$ , which means the fourth term is $2021$ . Continuing this process, we realize that the next term is $2019$ and each subsequent term is 2 fewer. This means the $n^{th}$ term of this sequence where $n>5$ is the the ${n-1}^{th}$ term minus 2. Realizing this is an arithmetic sequence and all the terms must be positive, we get the answer, $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }1014}$

## Solution 4 (Proof of Sol. 3)
If the first k terms average to $2028-k$ , note that they sum to $2028k-k^2$ . Then, $k+1$ terms average to $2027-k$ , so they sum to $-k^2+2026k+2027$ , so the ${k+1}^{th}$ term is $(-k^2+2026k+2027)-(2028k-k^2)$ , where $k \ge 3$ , so ${k+1}^{th}$ term is $2027-2k$ . Note that for this to be positive, $k \le 1013$ , so $k+1$ th term is the 1014th term, answer is 1014.
