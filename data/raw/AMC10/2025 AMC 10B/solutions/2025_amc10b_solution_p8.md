# 2025 AMC 10B Problem 8

## Problem

Emmy says to Max, "I ordered 36 math club sweatshirts today." Max asks, "How much did each shirt cost?" Emmy responds, "I'll give you a hint. The total cost was $\$ \underline A~\underline B~\underline B.\underline B~\underline A$ , where $A$ and $B$ are digits and $A \neq 0$ ." After a pause, Max says, "That was a good price." What is $A + B$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}~7 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~8 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~11 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~14 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~15$

## Solution 1
The problem is essentially telling us that $\underline A~\underline B~\underline B.\underline B~\underline A$ is divisible by $36$ , so it is divisible by $9$ . Then, by the divisibility by $9$ condition, \[A+B+B+B+A=2A+3B\equiv 0\pmod{9}\] This means that $A$ must be divisible by $3$ , or otherwise $2A+3B$ would not be divisible by $3$ and thus $9$ . Since $A\ne0$ , we must have one of $A=3,6,9$ .
But $A$ must be even or else the entire number would not be even and thus would not be divisible by $4$ . Hence $A=6$ . Then, $2\cdot 6+3B\equiv 0\pmod{9}$ , so $4+B\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ , and thus $B\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ . This yields $B=2,5,8$ , of which $B=5$ is the only number that allows $\underline A~\underline B~\underline B.\underline B~\underline A$ to be divisible by $4$ . Thus the answer is $6+5=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~11}$ .

## Solution 2 (Trial and Error)
A number is divisible by $36$ if it divisible by $4$ , and $9$ . The divisibility rule for $4$ requires the sum of the last 2 digits to also be a multiple of $4$ . The divisibility rule for 9 requires the sum of all digits to be divisible by $9$ . Using the first condition $A+B$ is a multiple of 4. We can list out all possibilities for this, since both $A$ and $B$ are digits. The possibilities are $(1,2),(1,6),...(9,6)$ for $A$ , and $B$ respectively. There are a total of $2$ digits that are $A$ 's and $3$ that are $B$ 's. So if the digits sum to $9$ , then $2A+3B$ is a multiple of 9. We can try plugging in numbers from our list earlier into the equation $2A+3B$ to find what values set the expression equal to a multiple of $9$ . By trying numbers $A=6$ , and $B=5$ . So then $A+B$ yields
$6+5=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~11}$ .
