# 2025 AMC 10B Problem 7

## Problem

Frances stands $15$ meters directly south of a locked gate in a fence that runs east-west. Immediately behind the fence is a box of chocolates, located $x$ meters east of the locked gate. An unlocked gate lies $9$ meters east of the box, and another unlocked gate lies $8$ meters west of the locked gate. Frances can reach the box by walking toward an unlocked gate, passing through it, and walking toward the box. It happens that the total distance Frances would travel is the same via either unlocked gate. What is the value of $x$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3 \frac{2}{7} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 3 \frac{3}{7} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3 \frac{4}{7} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 3 \frac{5}{7} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 3 \frac{6}{7}$

## Solution 1
Let Frances's location be $F$ , the locked gate be $L$ , the box be $B$ , the unlocked gate on the west be $U$ , and the unlocked gate on the east be $V$ . We are given that $FL = 15$ , $LB = x$ , $BV$ = 9, and $LU = 8$ . Because $FL$ is vertical and the fence is horizontal, $m \angle FLU = m \angle FLV = 90^\circ$ .
If Frances takes the western path, she must first travel the length of $FV$ , and then $x + 8$ meters. By the Pythagorean theorem, $FV = \sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = 17$ . The remaining distance from Francis and the box of chocolates after she walks that distance is $8 + x$ meters. Thus, the distance Francis travels if she takes the western path is $25 + x$ .
If Frances takes the eastern path, she first travels $\sqrt{(x + 9)^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{(x + 9)^2 + 225}$ meters, and then $9$ more meters. Her total distance on the eastern path is $\sqrt{(x + 9)^2 + 225} + 9$ meters.
Now, we set the two distances equal to each other: \[x + 25 = \sqrt{(x + 9)^2 + 225} + 9\] \[x + 16 = \sqrt{(x + 9)^2 + 225}\] \[x^2 + 32x + 256 = (x + 9)^2 + 225\] \[x^2 + 32x + 256 = x^2 + 18x + 81 + 225\] \[14x = 50\] \[x = \frac{50}{14} = \frac{25}{7}.\] This corresponds with the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\hspace{3pt}3\frac{4}{7}}$ .
