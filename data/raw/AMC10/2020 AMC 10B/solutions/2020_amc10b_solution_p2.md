# 2020 AMC 10B Problem 2

## Problem

Carl has $5$ cubes each having side length $1$ , and Kate has $5$ cubes each having side length $2$ . What is the total volume of these $10$ cubes?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 24 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 25 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 28 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 40 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 45$

## Solution 1
A cube with side length $1$ has volume $1^3=1$ , so $5$ of these will have a total volume of $5\cdot1=5$ .
A cube with side length $2$ has volume $2^3=8$ , so $5$ of these will have a total volume of $5\cdot8=40$ .
$5+40=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }45}$ .

## Solution 2 (more in depth about Solution 1)
The total volume of Carl's cubes is $5$ . This is because to find the volume of a cube or a rectangular prism, you have to multiply the height by the length by the width. So in this question, it would be $1 \times 1 \times 1$ . This is equal to $1$ . Since Carl has $5$ cubes, you will have to multiply $1$ by $5$ , to account for all the $5$ cubes.
Next, to find the total volume of Kate's cubes you have to do the same thing. Except, this time, the height, the width, and the length, are all $2$ , so it will be $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8.$ Now you have to multiply by $5$ to account for all the $5$ blocks. This is $40$ . So the total volume of Kate's cubes is $40$ .
Lastly, to find the total of Carl's and Kate's cubes, you must add the total volume of their cubes together. This is going to be $5+40=\boxed{\textbf{(E)} ~45}$ .
