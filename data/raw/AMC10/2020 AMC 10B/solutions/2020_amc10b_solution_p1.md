## Problem

What is the value of \[1-(-2)-3-(-4)-5-(-6)?\]

$\textbf{(A)}\ -20 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ -3 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 5 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 21$

## Solution 1
We know that when we subtract negative numbers, $a-(-b)=a+b$ .
The equation becomes $1+2-3+4-5+6 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 5}$ .

## Solution 2
Like Solution 1, we know that when we subtract $a-(-b)$ , that will equal $a+b$ as the opposite/negative of a negative is a positive. Thus, $1-(-2)-3-(-4)-5-(-6)=1+2-3+4-5+6$ . We can group together a few terms to make our computation a bit simpler. $1+(2-3)+4+(-5+6)= 1+(-1)+4+1=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 5}$ .

## Solution 3
Notice $1-(-2)-3-(-4)-5-(-6)$ has three groups: $1-(-2)$ , $-3-(-4)$ , $-5-(-6)$
The first group, $1-(-2)$ , can be expressed as $a-[-(a+1)]$ .
Simplify,
$a-[-(a+1)]$ is $2a+1$
The second and third groups can be expressed as $-c-[-(c+1)]$ .
Simplify,
$-c-[-(c+1)]$ is $1$
Thus, the sum of the three groups is $2 \cdot 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5$ or $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 5}$
