## Problem

The acute angles of a right triangle are $a^{\circ}$ and $b^{\circ}$ , where $a>b$ and both $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers. What is the least possible value of $b$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 3 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 5 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 7 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 11$

## Solution 1
Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$ and one of the angles is $90^{\circ}$ because it's a right triangle, $a^{\circ} + b^{\circ} = 90^{\circ}$ .
The greatest prime number less than $90$ is $89$ . If $a=89^{\circ}$ , then $b=90^{\circ}-89^{\circ}=1^{\circ}$ , which is not prime.
The next greatest prime number less than $90$ is $83$ . If $a=83^{\circ}$ , then $b=7^{\circ}$ , which IS prime, so we have our answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7}$ ~quacker88

## Solution 2
Looking at the answer choices, only $7$ and $11$ are coprime to $90$ . Testing $7$ , the smaller angle, makes the other angle $83$ which is prime, therefore our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7}$

## Solution 3 (Euclidean Algorithm)
It is clear that $\gcd(a,b)=1.$ By the Euclidean Algorithm, we have \[\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(a+b,b)=\gcd(90,b)=1,\] so $90$ and $b$ are relatively prime.
The least such prime number $b$ is $7,$ from which $a=90-b=83$ is also a prime number. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7}.$
