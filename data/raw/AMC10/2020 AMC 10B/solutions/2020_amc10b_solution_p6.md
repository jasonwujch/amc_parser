# 2020 AMC 10B Problem 6

## Problem

Driving along a highway, Megan noticed that her odometer showed $15951$ (miles). This number is a palindrome-it reads the same forward and backward. Then $2$ hours later, the odometer displayed the next higher palindrome. What was her average speed, in miles per hour, during this $2$ -hour period?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 50 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 55 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 60 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 65 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 70$

## Solution
In order to get the smallest palindrome greater than $15951$ , we need to raise the middle digit. If we were to raise any of the digits after the middle, we would be forced to also raise a digit before the middle to keep it a palindrome, making it unnecessarily larger.
So we raise $9$ to the next largest value, $10$ , but obviously, that's not how place value works, so we're in the $16000$ s now. To keep this a palindrome, our number is now $16061$ .
So Megan drove $16061-15951=110$ miles. Since this happened over $2$ hours, she drove at $\frac{110}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }55}$ mph. ~quacker88
