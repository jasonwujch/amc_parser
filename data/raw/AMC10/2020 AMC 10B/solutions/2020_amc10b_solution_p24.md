## Problem

How many positive integers $n$ satisfy \[\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor?\] (Recall that $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the greatest integer not exceeding $x$ .)

$\textbf{(A) } 2 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 6 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 30 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 32$

## Solution 1 (Fakesolve)
We can first consider the equation without a floor function:
\[\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \sqrt{n}\]
Multiplying both sides by 70 and then squaring:
\[n^2 + 2000n + 1000000 = 4900n\]
Moving all terms to the left:
\[n^2 - 2900n + 1000000 = 0\]
Now we can determine the factors:
\[(n-400)(n-2500) = 0\]
This means that for $n = 400$ and $n = 2500$ , the equation will hold without the floor function.
Now we can simply check the multiples of 70 around 400 and 2500 in the original equation, which we abbreviate as $L=R$ .
For $n = 330$ , $L=19$ but $18^2 < 330 < 19^2$ so $R=18$
For $n = 400$ , $L=20$ and $R=20$
For $n = 470$ , $L=21$ , $R=21$
For $n = 540$ , $L=22$ but $540 > 23^2$ so $R=23$
Now we move to $n = 2500$
For $n = 2430$ , $L=49$ and $49^2 < 2430 < 50^2$ so $R=49$
For $n = 2360$ , $L=48$ and $48^2 < 2360 < 49^2$ so $R=48$
For $n = 2290$ , $L=47$ and $47^2 < 2360 < 48^2$ so $R=47$
For $n = 2220$ , $L=46$ but $47^2 < 2220$ so $R=47$
For $n = 2500$ , $L=50$ and $R=50$
For $n = 2570$ , $L=51$ but $2570 < 51^2$ so $R=50$
Therefore we have 6 total solutions, $n = 400, 470, 2290, 2360, 2430, 2500 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) 6}}$

## Solution 2
This is my first solution here, so please forgive me for any errors.
We are given that \[\frac{n+1000}{70}=\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor.\]
We know $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ must be an integer, which means that $n+1000$ is divisible by $70$ . As $1000\equiv 20\pmod{70}$ , this means that $n\equiv 50\pmod{70}$ , so we can write $n=70k+50$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Note that $n$ has to be nonnegative for $\sqrt{n}$ to be defined. Thus, $n = 70k + 50 \geq 0$ . Simplifying this, we have $k \geq -5/7$ . In other words, $k$ also has to be nonnegative.
Therefore, \[\frac{n+1000}{70}=\frac{70k+1050}{70}=k+15=\lfloor\sqrt{70k+50}\rfloor.\]
Also, we can say that $\sqrt{70k+50}-1 < k+15$ and $k+15\leq\sqrt{70k+50}.$
Since $k$ is nonnegative, both sides of the second inequality are nonnegative, so we can square them to get $k^{2}+30k+225\leq70k+50\implies k^{2}-40k+175\leq 0\implies (k-5)(k-35)\leq0\implies 5\leq k\leq 35$ .
Similarly, solving the first inequality gives us $k < 19-\sqrt{155}$ or $k > 19+\sqrt{155}.$
We know that $\sqrt{155}$ is larger than $12$ and smaller than $13$ , so instead, we can say $k\leq 6$ or $k\geq 32$ .
Combining this with $5\leq k\leq 35$ , we get $k=5,6,32,33,34,35$ are all solutions for $k$ that give a valid solution for $n$ , meaning that our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) 6}}$ . -Solution By Qqqwerw

## Solution 3
We start with the given equation \[\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\] From there, we can start with the general inequality that $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \leq \sqrt{n} < \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1$ . This means that \[\dfrac{n+1000}{70} \leq \sqrt{n} < \dfrac{n+1070}{70}\] Solving each inequality separately gives us two inequalities: \[n - 70\sqrt{n} +1000 \leq 0 \rightarrow (\sqrt{n}-50)(\sqrt{n}-20)\leq 0 \rightarrow 20\leq \sqrt{n} \leq 50\] \[n-70\sqrt{n}+1070 > 0 \rightarrow \sqrt{n} < 35-\sqrt{155} , \sqrt{n} > 35+\sqrt{155}\] Simplifying and approximating decimals yields 2 solutions for one inequality and 4 for the other. Hence, the answer is $2+4 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 6}$ .

## Solution 4
Let $n$ be uniquely of the form $n=k^2+r$ where $0 \le r \le 2k \; \bigstar$ . Then, \[\frac{k^2+r+1000}{70} = k\] Rearranging and completeing the square gives \[(k-35)^2 + r = 225\] \[\Rightarrow r = (k-20)(50-k)\; \smiley\] This gives us \[(k-35)^2 \le (k-35)^2+r=225 \le (k-35)^2 + 2k\] Solving the left inequality shows that $20 \le k \le 50$ . Combing this with the right inequality gives that \[(k-35)^2+r=225 \le (k-35)^2 + 2k \le (k-35)^2+100\] which implies either $k \ge 47$ or $k \le 23$ . By directly computing the cases for $k = 20, 21, 22, 23, 47, 48, 49, 50$ using $\smiley$ , it follows that only $k = 22, 23$ yield and invalid $r$ from $\bigstar$ . Since each $k$ corresponds to one $r$ and thus to one $n$ (from $\smiley$ and the original form), there must be 6 such $n$ .

## Solution 5
Since the right-hand-side is an integer, so must be the left-hand-side. Therefore, we must have $n\equiv -20\pmod{70}$ ; let $n=70j-20$ . The given equation becomes \[j+14 = \lfloor \sqrt{70j-20} \rfloor\]
Since $\lfloor x \rfloor \leq x < \lfloor x \rfloor +1$ for all real $x$ , we can take $x=\sqrt{70j-20}$ with $\lfloor x \rfloor =j+14$ to get \[j+14 \leq \sqrt{70j-20} < j+15\] We can square the inequality to get \[196+28j+j^{2} \leq 70j-20 < 225 + 30j + j^{2}\] The left inequality simplifies to $(j-36)(j-6) \leq 0$ , which yields \[6 \le j \le 36.\] The right inequality simplifies to $(j-20)^2 - 155 > 0$ , which yields \[j < 20 - \sqrt{155} < 8 \quad \text{or} \quad j > 20 + \sqrt{155} > 32\]
Solving $j < 8$ , and $6 \le j \le 36$ , we get $6 \le j < 8$ , for $2$ values $j\in \{6, 7\}$ .
Solving $j >32$ , and $6 \le j \le 36$ , we get $32 < j \le 36$ , for $4$ values $k\in \{33, \ldots , 36\}$ .
Thus, our answer is $2 + 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$

## Solution 6
Set $x=\sqrt{n}$ in the given equation and solve for $x$ to get $x^2 = 70 \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor - 1000$ . Set $k = \lfloor x \rfloor \ge 0$ ; since $\lfloor x \rfloor^2 \le x^2 < (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1)^2$ , we get \[k^2 \le 70k - 1000 < k^2 + 2k + 1.\] The left inequality simplifies to $(k-20)(k-50) \le 0$ , which yields \[20 \le k \le 50.\] The right inequality simplifies to $(k-34)^2 > 155$ , which yields \[k < 34 - \sqrt{155} < 22 \quad \text{or} \quad k > 34 + \sqrt{155} > 46\] Solving $k < 22$ , and $20 \le k \le 50$ , we get $20 \le k < 22$ , for $2$ values $k\in \{20, 21\}$ .
Solving $k >46$ , and $20 \le k \le 50$ , we get $46 < k \le 50$ , for $4$ values $k\in \{47, \ldots , 50\}$ .
Thus, our answer is $2 + 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$

## Solution 7
If $n$ is a perfect square, we can write $n = k^2$ for a positive integer $k$ , so $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = \sqrt{n} = k.$ The given equation turns into
\begin{align*} \frac{k^2 + 1000}{70} &= k \\ k^2 - 70k + 1000 &= 0 \\ (k-20)(k-50) &= 0, \end{align*}
so $k = 20$ or $k= 50$ , so $n = 400, 2500.$
If $n$ is not square, then we can say that, for a positive integer $k$ , we have \begin{align*} k^2 < &n < (k+1)^2 \\ k^2 + 1000 < &n + 1000 = 70\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = 70k< (k+1)^2 + 1000 \\ k^2 + 1000 < &70k < (k+1)^2 + 1000. \end{align*}
To solve this inequality, we take the intersection of the two solution sets to each of the two inequalities $k^2 + 1000 < 70k$ and $70k < (k+1)^2 + 1000$ . To solve the first one, we have
\begin{align*} k^2 - 70k + 1000 &< 0 \\ (k-20)(k-50) &< 0\\ \end{align*} $k\in (20, 50),$ because the portion of the parabola between its two roots will be negative.
The second inequality yields
\begin{align*} 70k &< k^2 + 2k + 1 + 1000 \\ 0 &< k^2 -68k + 1001. \end{align*} This time, the inequality will hold for all portions of the parabola that are not on or between the its two roots, which are $34 + \sqrt{155}>46$ and $34-\sqrt{155}<22$ (they are roughly equal, but this is to ensure that we do not miss any solutions).
Notation wise, we need all integers $k$ such that
\[k \in \left(20, 50\right) \cap \left(-\infty,34 - \sqrt{155} \right)\] or \[k \in \left(20, 50\right) \cap \left(34 + \sqrt{155}, \infty \right).\]
For the first one, since our uppoer bound is a little less than $22$ , the $k$ that works is $21$ . For the second, our lower bound is a little more than $46$ , so the $k$ that work are $47, 48,$ and $49$ .
$\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ total solutions for $n$ , since each value of $k$ corresponds to exactly one value of $n$ .

## Solution 8
First, express $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = \sqrt{n} - \{\sqrt{n}\}$ and simplify the equation out: $\newline$ \begin{align*} n + 1000 = 70 \sqrt{n} - 70 \{\sqrt{n}\} \newline \end{align*} For simplicity, define $a = \sqrt{n}$ . Then, $a^2 + 1000 = 70a - 70 \{a\}$ Rearranging and factoring: $(a-20)(a-50) = -70 \{a\}$ We know that $0 \leq \{a\} < 1$ , so we can set $\{a\} = 0$ to obtain $a = 20, 50 \implies n = 400, 2500$ . For the next solutions, we can use the quadratic formula on the equation $a^2 - 70a + (1000+70\{a\}) = 0$ : $\newline$ \begin{align*} a = 35 \pm \sqrt{1225 - (1000 + 70\{a\})} = 35 \pm \sqrt{225-70\{a\}} \end{align*} $\newline$ Since \(a = 35 \pm \sqrt{225 - 70\{a\}}\) must produce real values of \(a\) that satisfy \(\lfloor a \rfloor = a - \{a\}\), the expression inside the square root must correspond to a value of \(a\) whose integer part stays consistent. Therefore, we only consider values of \(\{a\}\) that make \(a\) land near an integer, which happens when \(\sqrt{225 - 70\{a\}}\) is close to an integer. $\newline$ From earlier, we can use the bounds of $\{a\}$ to find out that $225-70\{a\}$ will approach a minimum of $225-70 = 155$ but never reach it. Now, we can just list out the perfect squares between 155 and 225, as setting $225-70\{a\}$ equal to that perfect square will result in an integer value of $a$ corresponding to an integer value of $n$ . $\newline$ The two perfect squares that satisfy these restrictions are $k = 13$ and $k = 14$ . Then, $a = 35 \pm 14 \implies a = 49, 21$ and $a = 35 \pm 13 \implies a = 48, 22$ . $\newline$ We know that each value of $a = \sqrt{n}$ corresponds to exactly one value of $n$ , so we have a total of $2 + 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6}$ total solutions for $n$ .
