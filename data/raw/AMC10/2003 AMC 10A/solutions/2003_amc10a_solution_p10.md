# 2003 AMC 10A Problem 10

## Problem

The polygon enclosed by the solid lines in the figure consists of 4 congruent squares joined edge -to-edge. One more congruent square is attached to an edge at one of the nine positions indicated. How many of the nine resulting polygons can be folded to form a cube with one face missing?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 2\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 3\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 4\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 5\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 6$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Let the squares be labeled $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , and $D$ .
When the polygon is folded, the "right" edge of square $A$ becomes adjacent to the "bottom edge" of square $C$ , and the "bottom" edge of square $A$ becomes adjacent to the "bottom" edge of square $D$ .
So, any "new" square that is attatched to those edges will prevent the polygon from becoming a cube with one face missing.
Therefore, squares $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ will prevent the polygon from becoming a cube with one face missing.
Squares $4$ , $5$ , $6$ , $7$ , $8$ , and $9$ will allow the polygon to become a cube with one face missing when folded.
Thus the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 6}$ .

## Solution 2
Another way to think of it is that a cube missing one face has $5$ of its $6$ faces. Since the shape has $4$ faces already, we need another face. The only way to add another face is if the added square does not overlap any of the others. $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ overlap, while squares $4$ to $9$ do not. The answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 6}$

## Solution 3
If you're good at visualizing, you can imagine each box and fold up the shape into a 3D shape. This solution is only recommended if you are either in a hurry or extremely skilled at visualizing. We find out that $4,5,6,7,8$ and $9$ work. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 6}$ . ~Sophia866
