# 2003 AMC 10A Problem 11

## Problem

The sum of the two 5-digit numbers $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ is $123422$ . What is $A+M+C$ ?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 10\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 11\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 12\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 13\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 14$

## Solution
$AMC10+AMC12=123422$
$AMC00+AMC00=123400$
$AMC+AMC=1234$
$2\cdot AMC=1234$
$AMC=\frac{1234}{2}=617$
Since $A$ , $M$ , and $C$ are digits, $A=6$ , $M=1$ , $C=7$ .
Therefore, $A+M+C = 6+1+7 = \boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 14}$ .

## Solution 2
We know that $AMC12$ is $2$ more than $AMC10$ . We set up $AMC10=x$ and $AMC12=x+2$ . We have $x+x+2=123422$ . Solving for $x$ , we get $x=61710$ . Therefore, the sum $A+M+C= 6+1+7 = \boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 14}$ .

## Solution 3
Consider the place values of the digits of $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ .
When we add $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ , $C + C$ must result in a units digit of $4$ , meaning $C$ is either $2$ or $7$ . Since $M$ is odd, this means a ten was carried over to the next place value from $C + C$ , and thus $C = 7$ (as $7 + 7 = 14$ and the ten is carried over). Now, we know 3 is the units digit of $M + M + 1$ , so $M$ is either $1$ or $6$ . Again, we must look at the digit before $M$ , or $A$ . $A$ is even, so $M$ must be less than $5$ , or else the ten would be carried over. Ergo, $M$ is $1$ . Nothing is carried over, so we have $A + A = 12$ , and $A = 6$ . Therefore, the sum of $A$ , $M$ , and $C$ is $6 + 1 + 7 = \boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 14}$ .

## Solution 4
Intuitively, adding $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ is the same as adding $AMC11$ to itself. We can divide $123422$ by $2$ to get $61711$ . So, $A$ = $6$ , $M$ = 1, and $C$ = $7$ . Adding all those up yields $6 + 1 + 7 = \boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 14}$ ~sdmd
