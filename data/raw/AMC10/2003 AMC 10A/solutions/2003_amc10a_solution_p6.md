## Problem

Define $x \heartsuit y$ to be $|x-y|$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ . Which of the following statements is not true?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } x \heartsuit y = y \heartsuit x$ for all $x$ and $y$

$\mathrm{(B) \ } 2(x \heartsuit y) = (2x) \heartsuit (2y)$ for all $x$ and $y$

$\mathrm{(C) \ } x \heartsuit 0 = x$ for all $x$

$\mathrm{(D) \ } x \heartsuit x = 0$ for all $x$

$\mathrm{(E) \ } x \heartsuit y > 0$ if $x \neq y$

## Solution
We start by looking at the answers. Examining statement C, we notice:
$x \heartsuit 0 = |x-0| = |x|$
$|x| \neq x$ when $x<0$ , but statement C says that it does for all $x$ .
Therefore the statement that is not true is $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ x\heartsuit 0=x\ \text{for all}\ x}$
