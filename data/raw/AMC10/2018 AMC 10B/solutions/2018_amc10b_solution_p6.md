# 2018 AMC 10B Problem 6

## Problem

A box contains $5$ chips, numbered $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , $4$ , and $5$ . Chips are drawn randomly one at a time without replacement until the sum of the values drawn exceeds $4$ . What is the probability that $3$ draws are required?

$\textbf{(A)} \frac{1}{15} \qquad \textbf{(B)} \frac{1}{10} \qquad \textbf{(C)} \frac{1}{6} \qquad \textbf{(D)} \frac{1}{5} \qquad \textbf{(E)} \frac{1}{4}$

## Solution 1
Notice that the only four ways such that $3$ draws are required are $1,2$ ; $1,3$ ; $2,1$ ; and $3,1$ . Notice that each of those cases has a $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4}$ chance, so the answer is $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{5}$ , or $\boxed{D}$ .

## Solution 1.1
Since our favorable outcomes are $1,2$ ; $1,3$ ; $2,1$ ; and $3,1$ , we have 4 favorable outcomes. We have 20 total outcomes. Probability will be $\frac{1}{5}$ . Hence the answer is $\boxed{D}$ .

## Solution 2
We only have to analyze the first two draws as that gives us insight into if a third draw is necessary. Also, note that it is necessary to draw a $1$ to have 3 draws, otherwise $5$ will be attainable in two or fewer draws. So the probability of getting a $1$ is $\frac{1}{5}$ . It is necessary to pull either a $2$ or $3$ on the next draw and the probability of that is $\frac{1}{2}$ . But, the order of the draws can be switched so we get:
$\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{5}$ , or $\boxed {D}$

## Solution 3 (Inequalities)
We know that the first $2$ draws must be $\le{3}$ leaving us with with the only option being that $1$ and $2$ are chosen in either order. This means there is a probability of $\frac{1}{\binom52} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{5}$ , or $\boxed {D}$
