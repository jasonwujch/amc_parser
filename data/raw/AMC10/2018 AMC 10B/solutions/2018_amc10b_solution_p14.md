# 2018 AMC 10B Problem 14

## Problem

A list of $2018$ positive integers has a unique mode, which occurs exactly $10$ times. What is the least number of distinct values that can occur in the list?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 202\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 223\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 224\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 225\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 234$

## Solution 1 (Statistics)
To minimize the number of distinct values, we want to maximize the number of times a number appears. So, we could have $223$ numbers appear $9$ times, $1$ number appear once, and the mode appear $10$ times, giving us a total of $223 + 1 + 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 225}.$

## Solution 2 (Algebra)
As in Solution 1, we want to maximize the number of time each number appears to do so. We can set up an equation $10 + 9( x - 1 )\geq2018,$ where $x$ is the number of values. Notice how we can then rearrange the equation into $1 + 9 ( 1 )+9 ( x - 1 )\geq2018,$ which becomes $9 x\geq2017,$ or $x\geq224\frac19.$ We cannot have a fraction of a value so we must round up to $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 225}.$

## Solution 3 (Literally Solution 1)
There is a unique number \( n \) with a mode of 10. This means we have 2008 terms left. We see that \( \lfloor 2008/9 \rfloor = 223 \), with remainder 1. Our answer is simply \( 223 + 1 + 1 =\) $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 225}.$
