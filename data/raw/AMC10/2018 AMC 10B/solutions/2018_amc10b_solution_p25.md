# 2018 AMC 10B Problem 25

## Problem

Let $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ . How many real numbers $x$ satisfy the equation $x^2 + 10,000\lfloor x \rfloor = 10,000x$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 197 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 198 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 199 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 200 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 201$

## Solution 1
This rewrites itself to $x^2=10,000\{x\}$ where $\lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\} = x$ .
Graphing $y=10,000\{x\}$ and $y=x^2$ we see that the former is a set of line segments with slope $10,000$ from $0$ to $1$ with a hole at $x=1$ , then $1$ to $2$ with a hole at $x=2$ etc. Here is a graph of $y=x^2$ and $y=16\{x\}$ for visualization.
[asy] import graph; size(400); xaxis("$x$",Ticks(Label(fontsize(8pt)),new real[]{-5,-4,-3, -2, -1,0,1 2,3, 4,5})); yaxis("$y$",Ticks(Label(fontsize(8pt)),new real[]{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18})); real y(real x) {return x^2;} draw(circle((-4,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((-3,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((-2,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((-1,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((0,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((1,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((2,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((3,16), 0.1)); draw(circle((4,16), 0.1)); draw((-5,0)--(-4,16), black); draw((-4,0)--(-3,16), black); draw((-3,0)--(-2,16), black); draw((-2,0)--(-1,16), black); draw((-1,0)--(-0,16), black); draw((0,0)--(1,16), black); draw((1,0)--(2,16), black); draw((2,0)--(3,16), black); draw((3,0)--(4,16), black); draw(graph(y,-4.2,4.2),green); [/asy]
Now notice that when $x=\pm 100$ the graph has a hole at $(\pm 100,10,000)$ which the equation $y=x^2$ passes through and then continues upwards. Thus our set of possible solutions is bounded by $(-100,100)$ . We can see that $y=x^2$ intersects each of the lines once and there are $99-(-99)+1=199$ lines for an answer of $\boxed{\text{(C)}~199}$ .

## Solution 2
Same as the first solution, $x^2=10,000\{x\}$ .
We can write $x$ as $\lfloor x \rfloor+\{x\}$ . Expanding everything, we get a quadratic in $\{x\}$ in terms of $\lfloor x \rfloor$ : \[\{x\}^2+ (2\lfloor x \rfloor -10,000)\{x\} + \lfloor x \rfloor ^2 = 0\]
We use the quadratic formula to solve for $\{x\}$ : \[\{x\} = \frac {-2\lfloor x \rfloor + 10,000 \pm \sqrt{ ( 2\lfloor x \rfloor - 10,000 )^2 - 4\lfloor x \rfloor^2 }}{2} = \frac {-2\lfloor x \rfloor + 10,000 \pm \sqrt{ 4\lfloor x \rfloor^2 -40,000 \lfloor x \rfloor + 10,000^2- 4\lfloor x \rfloor^2 }}{2}\]
Since $0 \leq \{x\} < 1$ , we get an inequality which we can then solve. After simplifying a lot, we get that $\lfloor x \rfloor^2 + 2\lfloor x \rfloor - 9999 < 0$ .
Solving over the integers, $-101 < \lfloor x \rfloor < 99$ , and since $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is an integer, there are $\boxed{\text{(C)}~199}$ solutions. Each value of $\lfloor x \rfloor$ should correspond to one value of $x$ , so we are done.

## Solution 3 (Fakesolve)
Let $x = a+k$ where $a$ is the integer part of $x$ and $k$ is the fractional part of $x$ . We can then rewrite the problem below:
$(a+k)^2 + 10000a = 10000(a+k)$
From here, we get
$(a+k)^2 + 10000a = 10000a + 10000k$
Solving for $a+k = x$
$(a+k)^2 = 10000k$
$x = a+k = \pm100\sqrt{k}$
Because $0 \leq k < 1$ , we know that $a+k$ cannot be less than or equal to $-100$ nor greater than or equal to $100$ . Therefore:
$-99 \leq x \leq 99$
There are $199$ elements in this range, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} \text{ 199}}$ .
Note (not by author): this solution seems to be invalid at first, because one can not determine whether $x$ is an integer or not. However, it actually works because although $x$ itself might not be an integer, it is very close to one, so there are 199 potential $x$ .
Another Note (not by author of previous note): we can actually determine that $x$ =0 is the only possible integer value of $x$ is we set $x$ = $\lfloor x \rfloor$ we end up with $x$ =0 ~YJC64002776
Yet Another Note EXCEPT THIS ONE'S VERY IMPORTANT, AS IT DISPROVES THE PROOF (also not by the author of any previous notes or of the original solution): this solution claims that $-99 \leq x \leq 99$ , which is not entirely true. When $x = 5000-1000\sqrt{26}$ , the equation originally stated in the question holds true. $5000-1000\sqrt{26}$ is roughly $-99.0195$ (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth), which is not in the $-99 \leq x \leq 99$ interval. It is probably by mere coincidence that this solution gives the correct answer, as the solution is not rigorous. Additionally, $x$ is not necessarily integer, so it is not claimable that there are 199 elements in the range of $-99 \leq x \leq 99$ .
One More Note (not by any of the previous authors): The original guy who wrote the solution just wrote the wrong range lol this is a valid solution (at least I'm pretty sure). Given $(a+k)^2 = 10000k$ , dividing each side by 10000 gives $\frac{(a+k)^2}{10000} = k$ . Our original definition of $k$ states that $0 \leq k < 1$ , so $0 \leq \frac{(a+k)^2}{10000} < 1$ . This is equivalent to the range $-100 \leq x < 100$ NOT $-99 \leq x < 99$ . If you observe the functions behavior, you realize that between every interval of length $1$ there is one solution, except for the intervals that include $0$ , where only $0$ is a solution. There are therefore $99+99+1$ solutions in that range which gives the answer. Also $x$ literally doesn't have to be an integer the original constraint was that $x$ is a real number.

## Solution 4
Notice the given equation is equivalent to $(\lfloor x \rfloor+\{x\})^2=10,000\{x\}$
Now we know that $\{x\} < 1$ so plugging in $1$ for $\{x\}$ we can find the upper and lower bounds for the values.
$(\lfloor x \rfloor +1)^2 = 10,000(1)$
$(\lfloor x \rfloor +1) = \pm 100$
$\lfloor x \rfloor = 99, -101$
And just like $\textbf{Solution 2}$ , we see that $-101 < \lfloor x \rfloor < 99$ , and since $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is an integer, there are $\boxed{\text{(C)}~199}$ solutions. Each value of $\lfloor x \rfloor$ should correspond to one value of $x$ , so we are done.
- $\textbf{Note}$ (not by author of any other notes beforehand): this solution is probably the best and most efficient of all. It solves the problems stated in the fakesolves./

## Solution 5
Firstly, if $x$ is an integer, then $10,000\lfloor x \rfloor=10,000x$ , so $x$ must be $0$ .
If $0<x<1$ , then we know the following:
$0<x^2<1$
$10,000\lfloor x \rfloor =0$
$0<10,000x<10,000$
Therefore, $0<x^2+10,000\lfloor x \rfloor <1$ , which overlaps with $0<10,000x<10,000$ . This means that there is at least one real solution between $0$ and $1$ . Since $x^2+10,000\lfloor x \rfloor$ increases quadratically and $10,000x$ increases linearly, there is only one solution for this case.
Similarly, if $1<x<2$ , then we know the following:
$1<x^2<4$
$10,000\lfloor x \rfloor =10,000$
$<10,000<10,000x<20,000$
By following similar logic, we can find that there is one solution between $1$ ad $2$ .
We can also follow the same process to find that there are negative solutions for $x$ as well.
There are not an infinite amount of solutions, so at one point there will be no solutions when $n<x<n+1$ for some integer $n$ . For there to be no solutions in a given range means that the range of $10,000\lfloor x \rfloor + x^2$ does not intersect the range of $10,000x$ . $x^2$ will always be positive, and $10,000\lfloor x \rfloor$ is less than $10,000$ less than $10,000x$ , so when $x^2 >= 10,000$ , the equation will have no solutions. This means that there are $99$ positive solutions, $99$ negative solutions, and $0$ for a total of $\boxed{\text{(C)}~199}$ solutions.

## Solution 6 (General Equation)
General solution to this type of equation $f(x, \lfloor x \rfloor) = 0$ :
$x^2 - 10000x + 10000 \lfloor x \rfloor =0$
$x=5000 \pm 100 \sqrt{2500- \lfloor x \rfloor}$ , $\lfloor x \rfloor \le 2500$
$\lfloor x \rfloor \le x < \lfloor x \rfloor + 1$
If $x= 5000 + 100 \sqrt{2500 - \lfloor x \rfloor}$ , $x \ge 5000$ , it contradicts $x < \lfloor x \rfloor + 1 \le 2501$
So $x= 5000 - 100 \sqrt{2500 - \lfloor x \rfloor}$
Let $k = \lfloor x \rfloor$ , $x= 5000 - 100 \sqrt{2500 - k}$
$k \le 5000 - 100 \sqrt{2500 - k} < k + 1$
$0 \le 5000 - k - 100 \sqrt{2500 - k} < 1$
$0 \le 2500 - k - 100 \sqrt{2500 - k} + 2500 < 1$
$0 \le (\sqrt{2500 - k} - 50)^2 < 1$
$-1 < \sqrt{2500 - k} - 50 < 1$
$49 < \sqrt{2500 - k} < 51$
$-101 < k < 99$
So the number of $k$ 's values is $99-(-101)-1=199$ . Because $x=5000-100\sqrt{2500-k}$ , for each value of $k$ , there is a value for $x$ . The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} 199}$

## Solution 7 (Fakesolve)
Subtracting $10000\lfloor x\rfloor$ from both sides gives $x^2=10000(x-\lfloor x\rfloor)=10000\{x\}$ . Dividing both sides by $10000$ gives $\left(\frac{x}{100}\right)^2=\{x\}<1$ . $\left(\frac{x}{100}\right)^2<1$ when $-100<x<100$ so the answer is $\boxed{199}$ .

## Solution 8 (Also Gives General Formula For Values of x)
The question wants to know how many values of $x$ satisfy the equation $x^2 + 10,000\lfloor x \rfloor = 10,000x$ . This equation can be simplified as follows
\[x^2 + 10,000\lfloor x \rfloor = 10,000x\]
\[x^2 = 10,000(x-\lfloor x \rfloor)\]
Notice that $x-\lfloor x \rfloor$ must be greater than or equal to zero, but less than one. Because of that, the right-hand side of the equation must be less than $10000$ . Therefore, $-100<x<100$ .
$x$ can be expressed as $a+b$ , where $a$ is an integer and $b$ is a real number such that $0 \leq b < 1$ . Notice that in order to satisfy the conditions set down for $x$ , $-100 \leq a \leq 99$ .
Substituting $a$ and $b$ into $x^2 = 10000(x-\lfloor x \rfloor)$ , we get
\[(a+b)^2 = 10,000b\]
\[a^2+2ab+b^2 = 10,000b\]
Let's try to turn this into a quadratic equation where we're trying to solve for $b$ . Simplifying, we find
\[b^2+(2a-10,000)b+a^2 = 0\]
Now the value of $b$ depends on the value of $a$ . Our task is to figure out how many values of $a$ will give me valid values of $b$ (a.k.a the values of $a$ that give me $b$ such that $0 \leq b < 1$ ), as that will be our answer. We must also keep in mind that $-100 \leq a \leq 99$ .
Using the quadratic formula, we can find
\[\frac{(-2a+10,000) \pm \sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}}{2}\]
The equation above represents the values of $b$ in terms of $a$ . Since it represents $b$ , we want values of $a$ such that the equation is between zero and one, zero inclusive. We can then conceive the inequality below.
\[0 \leq \frac{(-2a+10,000) \pm \sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}}{2} < 1\]
Wow, that looks like a mess! How are we supposed to easily use such a complicated expression? Maybe it would help to simplify it further. First, let's notice a few things.
- I want the numerator to be between 0 and 2, 0 inclusive. Of the $\pm$ in the quadratic formula, only the " $-$ " (minus) will work. Why? Because $-2a+10000$ will always be positive (if I plug in the largest possible value of $a$ , $99$ , it will give $9802$ ), and if I want $b$ to be real, which I do, then $\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}$ should also be positive. $-2a+10000$ will already be much bigger than 2, and adding more on will only make it bigger. It will never be less than 2. It will never work.
- I can simplify the numbers under the square root using Difference of Squares. I can turn $\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-4a^2}$ into $\sqrt{(2a-10,000)^2-(2a)^2}$ . Applying Difference of Squares, it will eventually simplify out to be $200\sqrt{2500-a}$ .
Cool! Now we've simplified the square root and figured out that it must be a minus sign, not a plus sign. Our new inequality looks like this:
\[0 \leq \frac{(-2a+10,000) - 200\sqrt{2500-a}}{2} < 1\]
Simplifying the unsimplified fraction further, we can get this:
\[0 \leq -a + 5,000 - 100\sqrt{2500-a} < 1\]
Yay! A simpler equation. As long as the value $a$ fits this inequality, the restrictions set on $b$ are satisfied. But wait. What about the restrictions on $a$ ?
By testing out and (and finding that gives a value very close to , and that gives exactly ), we can conclude that any value of a will satisfy the inequality above as long as it does not make equal to . By testing and , you will also find that will not satisfy the inequality. <-- old, non-rigorous way. You can ignore it, but if you want to see a bogus way to prove it, feel free to read it.
I can solve $0 \leq -a + 5000 - 100\sqrt{2500-a} < 1$ for $a$ this way:
$0 \leq -a + 5000 - 100\sqrt{2500-a} < 1$
$-5000 \leq -a - 100\sqrt{2500-a} < -4999$
$5000 \geq a + 100\sqrt{2500-a} < 4999$
$5000-a \geq 100\sqrt{2500-a} < 4999-a$
$25000000-10000a+a^2 \geq 25000000-10000a > 4999^2-9998a+a^2$
$a^2 \geq 0 > -9999+2a+a^2$
$0 \geq -a^2 > -9999+2a$
$0 \leq a^2 < 9999-2a$
$2a \leq a(a+2) < 9999$
Following the left part of the inequality,
$2a \leq a^2 + 2a$
$0 \leq a^2$
$a$ can be anything $(-\infty, \infty)$ .
Following the right part of the inequality,
$a(a+2) < 9999$
$a < 99$ and $a > -101$
$a$ can be anything $(-101, 99)$ .
Combining both restrictions and given previously that $-100 \leq a \leq 99$ , we can conclude that the inequality describing all possible values of $a$ is $-100 \leq a < 99$ .
Remember how these values of $a$ give valid values of $b$ that satisfy the desired inequality $0 \leq b < 1$ and how adding up $a$ and $b$ gives $x$ . In summary, remember that the number of values of $a$ is equivalent to the number of values of $x$ .
$a$ must be integer, so the number of values of $a$ that satisfy $-100 \leq a < 99$ is $\boxed{199}$ .
The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} 199}$ .

Note From Author of Solution: you may have noticed that I missed a slight bit by not proving that the thing under the square root in the quadratic formula I made was positive. Don't worry, it wasn't a mistake. It's actually pretty easy to prove. I'll leave it to you to figure out how to do it!

## Solution 9
Note that the problem rearranges itself to $x^2=10,000\{x\}$ where $\lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\} = x$ .
To get a general scope of solutions, by noting that $0 \leq \{x\} < 1$ , we have that $0 \leq x^2 < 10,000$ . Therefore, $-100 < x < 100$ .
From here, it is easy to observe that there is one solution per each integer value of $-99 \leq \lfloor x \rfloor \leq 99$ . This can be reasoned by bounding $\{x\}$ for each $\lfloor x \rfloor$ (intuitively, this is because $\lfloor x \rfloor$ determines the fractional part: for each $\lfloor x \rfloor$ , you will be forced to choose the value of $\{x\}$ that will satisfy the equation).
Ultimately, the answer is $99+99+1 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)} 199}$ .
