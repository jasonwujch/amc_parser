# 2018 AMC 10B Problem 1

## Problem

Kate bakes a $20$ -inch by $18$ -inch pan of cornbread. The cornbread is cut into pieces that measure $2$ inches by $2$ inches. How many pieces of cornbread does the pan contain?

$\textbf{(A) } 90 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 100 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 180 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 200 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 360$

## Solution 1
The area of the pan is $20\cdot18=360$ . Since the area of each piece is $2\cdot2=4$ , there are $\frac{360}{4} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 90}$ pieces.

## Solution 2
By dividing each of the dimensions by $2$ , we get a $10\times9$ grid that makes $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 90}$ pieces.
