# 2009 AMC 10B Problem 1

## Problem

Each morning of her five-day workweek, Jane bought either a $50$ -cent muffin or a $75$ -cent bagel. Her total cost for the week was a whole number of dollars. How many bagels did she buy?

$\textbf{(A) } 1\qquad\textbf{(B) } 2\qquad\textbf{(C) } 3\qquad\textbf{(D) } 4\qquad\textbf{(E) } 5$

## Solution 1 (Observations: Replacements)
If Jane bought one more bagel but one fewer muffin, then her total cost for the week would increase by $25$ cents.
If Jane bought $1$ bagel, then she bought $4$ muffins. Her total cost for the week would be $75\cdot1+50\cdot4=275$ cents, or $2.75$ dollars. Clearly, she bought one more bagel but one fewer muffin at a total cost of $3.00$ dollars. Therefore, she bought $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}$ bagels.

## Solution 2 (Observations: Answer Choices)
- If Jane bought $1$ bagel, then she bought $4$ muffins. Her total cost for the week would be $75\cdot1+50\cdot4=275$ cents, or $2.75$ dollars. So, $\textbf{(A)}$ is incorrect.
- If Jane bought $2$ bagels, then she bought $3$ muffins. Her total cost for the week would be $75\cdot2+50\cdot3=300$ cents, or $3.00$ dollars. So, $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}$ is correct.
For completeness, we will check $\textbf{(C)},\textbf{(D)},$ and $\textbf{(E)}$ too. If you decide to use this solution on the real test, then you will not need to do that, as you want to save more time.
- If Jane bought $3$ bagels, then she bought $2$ muffins. Her total cost for the week would be $75\cdot3+50\cdot2=325$ cents, or $3.25$ dollars. So, $\textbf{(C)}$ is incorrect.
- If Jane bought $4$ bagels, then she bought $1$ muffin. Her total cost for the week would be $75\cdot4+50\cdot1=350$ cents, or $3.50$ dollars. So, $\textbf{(D)}$ is incorrect.
- If Jane bought $5$ bagels, then she bought $0$ muffins. Her total cost for the week would be $75\cdot5+50\cdot0=375$ cents, or $3.75$ dollars. So, $\textbf{(E)}$ is incorrect.

## Solution 3 (Arithmetic)
In this solution, all amounts are in the unit of cents.
Note that the amount spent on muffins must end in either $00$ or $50,$ and the amount spent on bagels must end in one of $00,25,50,$ or $75.$ Furthermore, the number of muffins bought and the number of bagels bought must sum to $5.$
We have two possible cases:
1. The amounts spent on muffins and bagels both end in $00.$
1. The amounts spent on muffins and bagels both end in $50.$
The number of muffins bought must be even, and the number of bagels bought must be a multiple of $4.$
In this case, there are no solutions.
The number of muffins bought must be odd, and the number of bagels bought must be $2$ more than a multiple of $4.$
In this case, the only solution is $3$ muffins and $2$ bagels, from which the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}.$
