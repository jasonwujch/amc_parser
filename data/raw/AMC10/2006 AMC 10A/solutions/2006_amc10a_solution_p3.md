## Problem

The ratio of Mary's age to Alice's age is $3:5$ . Alice is $30$ years old. How old is Mary?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 18\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 24\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 50$

## Solution 1
Let $m$ be Mary's age. Then $\frac{m}{30}=\frac{3}{5}$ . Solving for $m$ , we obtain $m=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }18}.$

## Solution 2
We can see this is a combined ratio of $8$ , $(5+3)$ . We can equalize by doing $30\div5=6$ , and $6\cdot3=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }18}$ . With the common ratio of $8$ and difference ratio of $6$ , we see $6\cdot8=30+18$ . Therefore, we can see our answer is correct.
