## Problem

Which of the following describes the graph of the equation $(x+y)^2=x^2+y^2$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } \text{the\,empty\,set}\qquad \textbf{(B) } \textrm{one\,point}\qquad \textbf{(C) } \textrm{two\,lines} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \textrm{a\,circle} \qquad \textbf{(E) } \textrm{the\,entire\,plane}$

## Solution
Expanding the left side, we have
$x^2+2xy+y^2=x^2+y^2\Longrightarrow 2xy=0\Longrightarrow xy=0\Longrightarrow x = 0 \textrm{ or } y = 0$
Thus there are two lines described in this graph, the horizontal line $y = 0$ and the vertical line $x=0$ . Thus, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\textrm{two\,lines}}$ .
