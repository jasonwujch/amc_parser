## Problem

A parabola with equation $y=x^2+bx+c$ passes through the points $(2,3)$ and $(4,3)$ . What is $c$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 2\qquad \textbf{(B) } 5\qquad \textbf{(C) } 7\qquad \textbf{(D) } 10\qquad \textbf{(E) } 11$

## Solution 1
Substitute the points $(2,3)$ and $(4,3)$ into the given equation for $(x,y)$ .
Then we get a system of two equations:
$3=4+2b+c$
$3=16+4b+c$
Subtracting the first equation from the second we have:
$0=12+2b$
$b=-6$
Then using $b=-6$ in the first equation:
$0=1+-12+c$
$c=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }11}$ .

## Solution 1.1
Alternatively, notice that since the equation is that of a conic parabola, the vertex is likely $(3,2)$ . Thus, the form of the equation of the parabola is $y - 2 = (x - 3)^2$ . Expanding this out, we find that $c=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }11}$ .

## Solution 2
The points given have the same $y$ -value, so the vertex lies on the line $x=\frac{2+4}{2}=3$ .
The $x$ -coordinate of the vertex is also equal to $\frac{-b}{2a}$ , so set this equal to $3$ and solve for $b$ , given that $a=1$ :
$x=\frac{-b}{2a}$
$3=\frac{-b}{2}$
$6=-b$
$b=-6$
Now the equation is of the form $y=x^2-6x+c$ . Now plug in the point $(2,3)$ and solve for $c$ :
$y=x^2-6x+c$
$3=2^2-6(2)+c$
$3=4-12+c$
$3=-8+c$
$c=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }11}$ .

## Solution 3
Substituting y into the two equations, we get:
$3=x^2+bx+c$
Which can be written as:
$x^2+bx+c-3=0$
$4$ and $2$ are the solutions to the quadratic. Thus:
$c-3=4\times2$
$c-3=8$
$c=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }11}$ .
