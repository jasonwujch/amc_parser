# 2006 AMC 10A Problem 20

## Problem

Six distinct positive integers are randomly chosen between $1$ and $2006$ , inclusive. What is the probability that some pair of these integers has a difference that is a multiple of $5$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(B) } \frac{3}{5}\qquad\textbf{(C) } \frac{2}{3}\qquad\textbf{(D) } \frac{4}{5}\qquad\textbf{(E) } 1\qquad$

## Solution
For two numbers to have a difference that is a multiple of $5$ , the numbers must be congruent $\bmod{5}$ (their remainders after division by $5$ must be the same).
$0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ are the possible values of numbers in $\bmod{5}$ . Since there are only $5$ possible values in $\bmod{5}$ and we are picking $6$ numbers, by the Pigeonhole Principle , two of the numbers must be congruent $\bmod{5}$ .
Therefore the probability that some pair of the $6$ integers has a difference that is a multiple of $5$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }1}$ .
