# 2006 AMC 10A Problem 4

## Problem

A digital watch displays hours and minutes with AM and PM. What is the largest possible sum of the digits in the display?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 17\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 19\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 21\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 22\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 23$

## Solution 1
From the greedy algorithm , we have $9$ in the hours section and $59$ in the minutes section. $9+5+9=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }23}$

## Solution 2 (matrix)
With a matrix, we can see $\begin{bmatrix} 1+2&9&6&3\\ 1+1&8&5&2\\ 1+0&7&4&1 \end{bmatrix}$ The largest single digit sum we can get is $9$ . For the minutes digits, we can combine the largest $2$ digits, which are $9,5 \Rightarrow 9+5=14$ , and finally $14+9=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }23}$

## Solution 3
We first note that since the watch displays time in AM and PM, the value for the hours section varies from $00-12$ . Therefore, the maximum value of the digits for the hours is when the watch displays $09$ , which gives us $0+9=9$ .
Next, we look at the value of the minutes section, which varies from $00-59$ . Let this value be a number $ab$ . We quickly find that the maximum value for $a$ and $b$ is respectively $5$ and $9$ .
Adding these up, we get $9+5+9=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }23}$ .
