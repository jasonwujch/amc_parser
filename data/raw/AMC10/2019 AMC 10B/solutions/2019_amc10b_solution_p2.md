# 2019 AMC 10B Problem 2

## Problem

Consider the statement, "If $n$ is not prime, then $n-2$ is prime." Which of the following values of $n$ is a counterexample to this statement?

$\textbf{(A) } 11 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 15 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 19 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 21 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 27$

## Solution
Since a counterexample must be a value of $n$ which is not prime, $n$ must be composite, so we eliminate $\text{A}$ and $\text{C}$ . Now we subtract $2$ from the remaining answer choices, and we see that the only time $n-2$ is not prime is when $n = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }27}$ .
