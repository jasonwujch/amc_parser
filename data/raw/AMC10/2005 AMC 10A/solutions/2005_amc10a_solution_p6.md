## Problem

The average (mean) of $20$ numbers is $30$ , and the average of $30$ other numbers is $20$ . What is the average of all $50$ numbers?

$\textbf{(A) } 23\qquad \textbf{(B) } 24\qquad \textbf{(C) } 25\qquad \textbf{(D) } 26\qquad \textbf{(E) } 27$

## Solution
Since the average of the first $20$ numbers is $30$ , their sum is $20\cdot30=600$ .
Since the average of $30$ other numbers is $20$ , their sum is $30\cdot20=600$ .
So the sum of all $50$ numbers is $600+600=1200$ .
Therefore, the average of all $50$ numbers is $\frac{1200}{50}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 24}$ .
