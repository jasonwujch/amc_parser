# 2005 AMC 10A Problem 5

## Problem

A store normally sells windows at $\$100$ each. This week the store is offering one free window for each purchase of four. Dave needs seven windows and Doug needs eight windows. How many dollars will they save if they purchase the windows together rather than separately?

$\textbf{(A) } 100\qquad \textbf{(B) } 200\qquad \textbf{(C) } 300\qquad \textbf{(D) } 400\qquad \textbf{(E) } 500$

## Solution
The store's offer means that every $5$ th window is free, so Dave would get $\left\lfloor\frac{7}{5}\right\rfloor=1$ free window and Doug would also get $\left\lfloor\frac{8}{5}\right\rfloor=1$ free window.
This is a total of $1+1 = 2$ free windows.
Together, by contrast, they would get $\left\lfloor\frac{8+7}{5}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\frac{15}{5}\right\rfloor=3$ free windows.
Hence they get $3-2=1$ additional window if they purchase the windows together, so the amount (in dollars) that they save is $1\cdot100= \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 100}$ .
