# 2005 AMC 10A Problem 7

## Problem

Josh and Mike live $13$ miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had Mike ridden when they met?

$\textbf{(A) } 4\qquad \textbf{(B) } 5\qquad \textbf{(C) } 6\qquad \textbf{(D) } 7\qquad \textbf{(E) } 8$

## Solution
Let $m$ be the distance in miles that Mike rode.
Since Josh rode for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate, he rode $2\cdot\frac{4}{5}\cdot m = \frac{8}{5}m$ miles.
Now, as their combined distance was $13$ miles, we deduce that $\frac{8}{5}m + m = 13 \iff \frac{13}{5}m = 13 \iff m = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }5}$ .
