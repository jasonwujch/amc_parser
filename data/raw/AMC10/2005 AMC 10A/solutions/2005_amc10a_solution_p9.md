# 2005 AMC 10A Problem 9

## Problem

Three tiles are marked $X$ and two other tiles are marked $O$ . The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads $XOXOX$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{12}\qquad \textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{10}\qquad \textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{6}\qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{1}{4}\qquad \textbf{(E) } \frac{1}{3}$

## Solution 1
There are $\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$ distinct arrangements of $3$ $X$ s and $2$ $O$ s, and only $1$ distinct arrangement that reads $XOXOX$ .
Therefore the desired probability is simply $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{10}}$ .

## Solution 2
Arranging the $3$ $X$ s and $2$ $O$ s in a row is equivalent to fitting the $O$ s into the gaps between the $X$ s.
There are a total of $3+1 = 4$ gaps between the $X$ s, so fitting $2$ $O$ s into these gaps gives $2$ possible outcomes:
1. The $2$ $O$ s are put into different gaps. In this case, the number of possible arrangements is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ .
2. The $2$ $O$ s are put into the same gap. In this case, as there are $4$ gaps, we simply obtain $4$ possible arrangements.
Therefore the probability of an arrangement that reads $XOXOX$ is $\frac{1}{4 + 6} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{10}}$ .
