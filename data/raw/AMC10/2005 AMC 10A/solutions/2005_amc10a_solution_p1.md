# 2005 AMC 10A Problem 1

## Problem

While eating out, Mike and Joe each tipped their server $\$2$ . Mike tipped $10\%$ of his bill and Joe tipped $20\%$ of his bill. What was the difference, in dollars, between their bills?

$\textbf{(A) } 2\qquad \textbf{(B) } 4\qquad \textbf{(C) } 5\qquad \textbf{(D) } 10\qquad \textbf{(E) } 20$

## Solution
Let $m$ be Mike's bill and $j$ be Joe's bill (both in dollars). We then have $\frac{10}{100}m = 2 \iff m = 20$ and $\frac{20}{100}j = 2 \iff j = 10$ , so the desired difference is $\left\lvert m-j\right\rvert = 20-10 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 10}$ .
