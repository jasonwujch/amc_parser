## Problem

How many positive integers $n$ satisfy the following condition:

\[\left(130n\right)^{50} > n^{100} > 2^{200} \ \text{?}\]

$\textbf{(A) } 0\qquad \textbf{(B) } 7\qquad \textbf{(C) } 12\qquad \textbf{(D) } 65\qquad \textbf{(E) } 125$

## Solution
Since $n > 0$ , all $3$ terms of the inequality are positive, so we may take the $50$ th root, yielding
\begin{align*}&\sqrt[50]{(130n)^{50}} > \sqrt[50]{n^{100}} > \sqrt[50]{2^{200}} \\ \iff &130n > n^2 > 2^4 \\ \iff &130n > n^2 > 16.\end{align*}
Solving each part separately, while noting that $n > 0$ , therefore gives $n^2 > 16 \iff n > 4$ and $130n > n^2 \iff n < 130$ .
Hence the solution is $4 < n < 130$ , and therefore the answer is the number of positive integers in the open interval $(4,130)$ , which is $129-5+1 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 125}$ .
