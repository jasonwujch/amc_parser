## Problem

Karl's rectangular vegetable garden is $20$ feet by $45$ feet, and Makenna's is $25$ feet by $40$ feet. Whose garden is larger in area?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{Karl's garden is larger by 100 square feet.}$

$\textbf{(B)}\ \text{Karl's garden is larger by 25 square feet.}$

$\textbf{(C)}\ \text{The gardens are the same size.}$

$\textbf{(D)}\ \text{Makenna's garden is larger by 25 square feet.}$

$\textbf{(E)}\ \text{Makenna's garden is larger by 100 square feet.}$

## Solution
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length times width. Karl's garden is $20 \times 45 = 900$ square feet and Makenna's garden is $25 \times 40 = 1000$ square feet. Since $1000 > 900,$ Makenna's garden is larger by $1000-900=100$ square feet. $\Rightarrow \boxed{ \textbf{(E)}\ \text{Makenna's garden is larger by 100 square feet.} }$
