# 2011 AMC 8 Problem 10

## Problem

The taxi fare in Gotham City is $2.40 for the first $\frac12$ mile and additional mileage charged at the rate $0.20 for each additional 0.1 mile. You plan to give the driver a $2 tip. How many miles can you ride for $10?

$\textbf{(A) }3.0\qquad\textbf{(B) }3.25\qquad\textbf{(C) }3.3\qquad\textbf{(D) }3.5\qquad\textbf{(E) }3.75$

## Solution 1 (Algebra)
Let $x$ be the number of miles you ride. The number of miles you ride after the first half mile is $x-0.5.$ We can write this equation:
\begin{align*} 10 &= 2.4 + 0.2 \times \frac{x-0.5}{0.1} + 2\\ 5.6 &= 2(x-0.5)\\ 2.8 &= x-0.5\\ x &= \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3.3}\end{align*}

## Solution 2 (Table)
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} Miles & Money & Remark\\ \hline 0 & 8 & \text{2 for tip} \\ \hline 0.5 & 5.6 & \text{-2.4 for first 0.5 mi} \\ \hline 3.3 & 0 & \text{-5.6 for 2.8 mi} \end{array}
Miles travelled = $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3.3}$
