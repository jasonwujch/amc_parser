## Problem

Margie bought $3$ apples at a cost of $50$ cents per apple. She paid with a 5-dollar bill. How much change did Margie receive?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \textdollar 1.50 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \textdollar 2.00 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \textdollar 2.50 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \textdollar 3.00 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \textdollar 3.50$

## Solution
$50$ cents is equivalent to $\textdollar 0.50.$ Then the three apples cost $3 \times \textdollar 0.50 = \textdollar 1.50.$ The change Margie receives is $\textdollar 5.00 - \textdollar 1.50 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ \textdollar 3.50}$
