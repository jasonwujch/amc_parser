# 2005 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Soda is sold in packs of 6, 12 and 24 cans. What is the minimum number of packs needed to buy exactly 90 cans of soda?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution
Start by buying the largest packs first. After three $24$ -packs, $90-3(24)=18$ cans are left. After one $12$ -pack, $18-12=6$ cans are left. Then buy one more $6$ -pack. The total number of packs is $3+1+1=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 5}$ .
