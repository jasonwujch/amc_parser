# 2005 AMC 8 Problem 6

## Problem

Suppose $d$ is a digit. For how many values of $d$ is $2.00d5 > 2.005$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 10$

## Solution
We see that $2.0055$ works but $2.0045$ does not. The digit $d$ can be from $5$ through $9$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 5}$ values.
