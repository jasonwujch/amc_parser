# 2005 AMC 8 Problem 7

## Problem

Bill walks $\tfrac12$ mile south, then $\tfrac34$ mile east, and finally $\tfrac12$ mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 1\tfrac14\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 1\tfrac12\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 1\tfrac34\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 2$

## Solution
We have a right-angle triangle with sides 3/4 and 1. We can divide the simple pythagorean theorem identity 3,4,5 by 4 to get 3/4, 1, 5/4. This shows us the answer is B, or 1 1/4.
