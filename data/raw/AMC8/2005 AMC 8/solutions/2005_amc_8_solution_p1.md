# 2005 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Connie multiplies a number by $2$ and gets $60$ as her answer. However, she should have divided the number by $2$ to get the correct answer. What is the correct answer?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 7.5\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 120\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 240$

## Solution
If $x$ is the number, then $2x=60$ and $x=30$ . Dividing the number by $2$ yields $\dfrac{30}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 15}$ .
A second way to do it is to divide the number by $4$ , as you multiplied by $2$ when you were supposed to divide by $2$ . So, $\dfrac{60}{4} = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 15}$ .
