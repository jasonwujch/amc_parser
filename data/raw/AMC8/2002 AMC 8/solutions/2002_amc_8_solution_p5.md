# 2002 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Carlos Montado was born on Saturday, November 9, 2002. On what day of the week will Carlos be 706 days old?

$\text{(A)}\ \text{Monday}\qquad\text{(B)}\ \text{Wednesday}\qquad\text{(C)}\ \text{Friday}\qquad\text{(D)}\ \text{Saturday}\qquad\text{(E)}\ \text{Sunday}$

## Solution 1
Days of the week have a cycle that repeats every $7$ days. Thus, after $100$ cycles, or $700$ days, it will be Saturday again. Six more days will make it $\text{Friday} \rightarrow \boxed{C}$

## Solution 2 (similar to solution 1)
Building off of solution 1, we can make things simpler by fast-forwarding $101$ cycles ( $707$ days) instead of $100$ cycles. Day $707$ would be a Saturday again, and one day before then (Day $706$ ) would be a Friday. Therefore the answer is $\boxed{(C)}$ .
