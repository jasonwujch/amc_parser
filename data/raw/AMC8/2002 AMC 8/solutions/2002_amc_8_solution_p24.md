# 2002 AMC 8 Problem 24

## Problem

Miki has a dozen oranges of the same size and a dozen pears of the same size. Miki uses her juicer to extract 8 ounces of pear juice from 3 pears and 8 ounces of orange juice from 2 oranges. She makes a pear-orange juice blend from an equal number of pears and oranges. What percent of the blend is pear juice?

$\text{(A)}\ 30\qquad\text{(B)}\ 40\qquad\text{(C)}\ 50\qquad\text{(D)}\ 60\qquad\text{(E)}\ 70$

## Solution 1
A pear gives $8/3$ ounces of juice per pear. An orange gives $8/2=4$ ounces of juice per orange. If the pear-orange juice blend used one pear and one orange each, the percentage of pear juice would be
\[\frac{8/3}{8/3+4} \times 100 = \frac{8}{8+12} \times 100 = \boxed{\text{(B)}\ 40}\]

## Solution 2
Since it doesn't matter how many pears and oranges there are, you can make the number of them whatever you like. In this case, we could use $6$ , because it's the LCM of $2$ and $3$ . Then for the $6$ pears, there are $6/3*8=16$ ounces of pear juice. For the 6 oranges, there are $6/2*8=24$ ounces of orange juice. Since we are looking for the percent of pear juice, we need to do $16/(16+24)=16/40$ . Simplifying, we get $2/5$ . Hence the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)}\ 40}$ .
