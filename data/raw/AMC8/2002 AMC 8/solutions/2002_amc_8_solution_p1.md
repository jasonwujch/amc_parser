# 2002 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

A circle and two distinct lines are drawn on a sheet of paper. What is the largest possible number of points of intersection of these figures?

$\text {(A)}\ 2 \qquad \text {(B)}\ 3 \qquad {(C)}\ 4 \qquad {(D)}\ 5 \qquad {(E)}\ 6$

## Solution
The two lines can both intersect the circle twice, and can intersect each other once, so $2+2+1= \boxed {\text {(D)}\ 5}.$
