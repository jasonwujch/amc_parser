## Solution1
You cannot use more than 4 $<dollar>5$ bills, but if you use 3 $<dollar>5$ bills, you can add another $<dollar>2$ bill to make a combination. You cannot use 2 $<dollar>5$ bills since you have an odd number of dollars that need to be paid with $<dollar>2$ bills. You can also use 1 $<dollar>5$ bill and 6 $<dollar>2$ bills to make another combination. There are no other possibilities, as making $<dollar>17$ with 0 $<dollar>5$ bills is impossible, so the answer is $\boxed {\text {(A)}\ 2}$ .
