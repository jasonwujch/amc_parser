# 2002 AMC 8 Problem 12

## Problem

A board game spinner is divided into three regions labeled $A$ , $B$ and $C$ . The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and on region $B$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ . The probability of the arrow stopping on region $C$ is:

$\text{(A)}\ \frac{1}{12}\qquad\text{(B)}\ \frac{1}{6}\qquad\text{(C)}\ \frac{1}{5}\qquad\text{(D)}\ \frac{1}{3}\qquad\text{(E)}\ \frac{2}{5}$

## Solution
Since the arrow must land in one of the three regions, the sum of the probabilities must be 1. Thus the answer is $1-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{\text{(B)}\ \frac16}$ .
