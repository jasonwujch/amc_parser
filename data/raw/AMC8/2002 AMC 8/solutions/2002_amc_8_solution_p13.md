# 2002 AMC 8 Problem 13

## Problem

For his birthday, Bert gets a box that holds 125 jellybeans when filled to capacity. A few weeks later, Carrie gets a larger box full of jellybeans. Her box is twice as high, twice as wide and twice as long as Bert's. Approximately, how many jellybeans did Carrie get?

$\text{(A)}\ 250\qquad\text{(B)}\ 500\qquad\text{(C)}\ 625\qquad\text{(D)}\ 750\qquad\text{(E)}\ 1000$

## Solution
Since the volume ratio is equal to the sides ratio cubed, then the ratio of the larger box's volume to the smaller one is 2 cubed.
$2^3=8$
Now multiply 125 (the number of jellybeans that Bert's box can hold) by 8.
$8\cdot125= \boxed{\text{(E)}\ 1000}$ .
