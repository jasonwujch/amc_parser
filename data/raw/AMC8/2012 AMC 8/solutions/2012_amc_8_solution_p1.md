## Problem

Rachelle uses 3 pounds of meat to make 8 hamburgers for her family. How many pounds of meat does she need to make 24 hamburgers for a neighbourhood picnic?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}6 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}6\dfrac23 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}7\dfrac12 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}8 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}9$

## Solution 1
Since Rachelle uses $3$ pounds of meat to make $8$ hamburgers, she uses $\frac{3}{8}$ pounds of meat to make one hamburger. She'll need 24 times that amount of meat for 24 hamburgers, or $\frac{3}{8} \cdot 24 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 9}$ .

## Solution 2
We have the proportion $\frac{3}{8}$ = $\frac{x}{24}$ . To solve for $x$ , multiply the left side of the equation by $\frac{3}{3}$ . This gives us $\frac{9}{24}=\frac{x}{24}$ . For $\frac{9}{24}$ to equal $\frac{x}{24}$ , we find that $x=9$ . The answer is then $\boxed{(E)}$ . ~Andrew_Lu with some small edits from: TabHawaii
