# 2012 AMC 8 Problem 21

## Problem

Marla has a large white cube that has an edge of 10 feet. She also has enough green paint to cover 300 square feet. Marla uses all the paint to create a white square centered on each face, surrounded by a green border. What is the area of one of the white squares, in square feet? $\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}5\sqrt2\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}10\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}10\sqrt2\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}50\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}50\sqrt2$

## Solution
If Marla evenly distributes her $300$ square feet of paint between the 6 faces, each face will get $300\div6 = 50$ square feet of paint. The surface area of one of the faces of the cube is $10^2 = 100$ square feet. Therefore, there will be $100-50 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 50}$ square feet of white on each side.
