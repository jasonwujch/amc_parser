# 2012 AMC 8 Problem 11

## Problem

The mean, median, and unique mode of the positive integers 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, and $x$ are all equal. What is the value of $x$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}5\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}6\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}7\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}11\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}12$

## Solution 1: Guess & Check
We can eliminate answer choices ${\textbf{(A)}\ 5}$ and ${\textbf{(C)}\ 7}$ , because of the above statement. Now we need to test the remaining answer choices.
Case 1: $x = 6$
Mode: $6$
Median: $6$
Mean: $\frac{37}{7}$
Since the mean does not equal the median or mode, ${\textbf{(B)}\ 6}$ can also be eliminated.
Case 2: $x = 11$
Mode: $6$
Median: $6$
Mean: $6$
We are done with this problem, because we have found when $x = 11$ , the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{{\textbf{(D)}\ 11}}$ .

## Solution 2: Algebra
Notice that the mean of this set of numbers, in terms of $x$ , is:
$\frac{3+4+5+6+6+7+x}{7} = \frac{31+x}{7}$
Because we know that the mode must be $6$ (it can't be any of the numbers already listed, as shown above, and no matter what $x$ is, either $6$ or a new number, it will not affect $6$ being the mode), and we know that the mode must equal the mean, we can set the expression for the mean and $6$ equal:
\[\dfrac{31+x}{7}=6\] \[31+x=42\] \[x=\boxed{\text{(D) } 11}\]

## Solution 3: Balance scale
We know the unique mode must be $6$ , so the mean must be the same number $6$ . Let's imagine a scale. $6$ exactly stands the mid-point of the scale. Numbers of $3,4,5$ represent the left side "weights" of the scale. Numbers of $6,7, x$ represent the right side "weights" of the scale. On the left side, the difference of the three "weights" between $6$ are $-3, -2, -1$ , respectively. It gives us the total difference is $-6$ . In order to allow the scale to keep balance, on the right side, the total difference must be $+6$ . Because we have already known the difference of the right side "weights" between $6$ is $0+1=1$ , partially, so the difference between $6$ and unknown $x$ must be $+6-1=+5$ . It exactly gives us the answer: $x=6+5= \boxed{{\textbf{(D)}\ 11}}$ . ---LarryFlora

## Solution 4: Must be an integer(Super fast)
Since all the answer choices are integers, we know that $\frac{3+4+5+6+6+7+x}{7}$ , which simplifies to $\frac{31+x}{7}$ , must be an integer. The only answer choice that satisfies this is $\boxed{{\textbf{(D)}\ 11}}$ .
Edit: The only answer choice that keeps $\frac{31+x}{7}$ equal to the mode, 6, is $\boxed{{\textbf{(D)}\ 11}}$
