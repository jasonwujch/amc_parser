$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}40\text{ and }50\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}51\text{ and }55\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}56\text{ and }60\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}61\text{ and }65\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}66\text{ and }99$

## Solution
To find the answer to this problem, we need to find the least common multiple of $3$ , $4$ , $5$ , $6$ and add $2$ to the result. To calculate the least common multiple, we need to find the prime factorization for each of them. $3 = 3^{1}$ , $4 = 2^{2}$ , $5 = 5^{1}$ , and $6 = 2^{1}*{3^{1}}$ . So the least common multiple of the four numbers is $2^{2}*{3^{1}*{5^{1}}} = 60$ , and by adding $2$ , we find that that such number is $62$ . Now we need to find the only given range that contains $62$ . The only such range is answer $\textbf{(D)}$ , and so our final answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 61\text{ and }65}$ .
