# 2012 AMC 8 Problem 16

## Problem

Each of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 is used only once to make two five-digit numbers so that they have the largest possible sum. Which of the following could be one of the numbers?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}76531\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}86724\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}87431\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}96240\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}97403$

## Solution 1
In order to maximize the sum of the numbers, the numbers must have their digits ordered in decreasing value. There are only two numbers from the answer choices with this property: $76531$ and $87431$ . To determine the answer we will have to use estimation and the first two digits of the numbers.
For $76531$ the number that would maximize the sum would start with $98$ . The first two digits of $76531$ (when rounded) are $77$ . Adding $98$ and $77$ , we find that the first three digits of the sum of the two numbers would be $175$ .
For $87431$ the number that would maximize the sum would start with $96$ . The first two digits of $87431$ (when rounded) are $87$ . Adding $96$ and $87$ , we find that the first three digits of the sum of the two numbers would be $183$ .
From the estimations, we can say that the answer to this problem is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 87431}$ .

## Solution 2
In order to determine the largest number possible, we have to evenly distribute the digits when adding. The two numbers that show an example of this are $97531$ and $86420$ . The digits can be interchangeable between numbers because we only care about the actual digits.
The first digit must be either $9$ or $8$ . This immediately knocks out $\textbf{(A)}\ 76531$ .
The second digit must be either $7$ or $6$ . This doesn't cancel any choices.
The third digit must be either $5$ or $4$ . This knocks out $\textbf{(B)}\ 86724$ and $\textbf{(D)}\ 96240$ .
The fourth digit must be $3$ or $2$ . This cancels out $\textbf{(E)}\ 97403$ .
This leaves us with $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 87431}$ .

## Solution 3
If we use intuition, we know that the digits will be IN ORDER, to maximze the number. This eliminates $\textbf{(B)}$ , $\textbf{(D)}$ ,and $\textbf{(E)}$ . Additionally, the 2 two numbers must have 9 and 8 for the first digit to maximize the sum, eliminating $\textbf{(A)}$ . This leaves $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 87431}$ . -written by litttle_master purely, not copied from anywhere
