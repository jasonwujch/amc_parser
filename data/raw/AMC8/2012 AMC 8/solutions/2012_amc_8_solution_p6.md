## Problem

A rectangular photograph is placed in a frame that forms a border two inches wide on all sides of the photograph. The photograph measures $8$ inches high and $10$ inches wide. What is the area of the border, in square inches?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}36\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}40\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}64\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}72\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}88$

## Solution
In order to find the area of the frame, we need to subtract the area of the photograph from the area of the photograph and the frame together. The area of the photograph is $8 \times 10 = 80$ square inches. The height of the whole frame (including the photograph) would be $8+2+2 = 12$ , and the width of the whole frame, $10+2+2 = 14$ . Therefore, the area of the whole figure would be $12 \times 14 = 168$ square inches. Subtracting the area of the photograph from the area of both the frame and photograph, we find the answer to be $168-80 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 88}$ .
