## Problem

What is the correct ordering of the three numbers $\frac{5}{19}$ , $\frac{7}{21}$ , and $\frac{9}{23}$ , in increasing order?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}\frac{9}{23}<\frac{7}{21}<\frac{5}{19}\quad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}\frac{5}{19}<\frac{7}{21}<\frac{9}{23}\quad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}\frac{9}{23}<\frac{5}{19}<\frac{7}{21}$

$\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}\frac{5}{19}<\frac{9}{23}<\frac{7}{21}\quad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}\frac{7}{21}<\frac{5}{19}<\frac{9}{23}$

## Solution 1
The value of $\frac{7}{21}$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ . Now we give all the fractions a common denominator.
$\frac{5}{19} \implies \frac{345}{1311}$
$\frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{437}{1311}$
$\frac{9}{23} \implies \frac{513}{1311}$
Ordering the fractions from least to greatest, we find that they are in the order listed. Therefore, our final answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{5}{19}<\frac{7}{21}<\frac{9}{23}}$ .

## Solution 2
Change $7/21$ into $1/3$ ; \[\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{5}{5}=\frac{5}{15}\] \[\frac{5}{15}>\frac{5}{19}\] \[\frac{7}{21}>\frac{5}{19}\] And \[\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{9}{9}=\frac{9}{27}\] \[\frac{9}{27}<\frac{9}{23}\] \[\frac{7}{21}<\frac{9}{23}\] Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{5}{19}<\frac{7}{21}<\frac{9}{23}}$ .

## Solution 3 (quick and easy)
We know that $\frac{5}{19}$ is $\frac{14}{19}$ away from $1$ , $\frac{7}{21}$ is $\frac{14}{21}$ away from $1$ , and $\frac{9}{23}$ is $\frac{14}{23}$ away from $1$ . Since $\frac{14}{19}$ is the largest, we know that it is the farthest away from 0, and $\frac{14}{23}$ is the smallest, so it is the closest to 0. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{5}{19}<\frac{7}{21}<\frac{9}{23}}$ .
