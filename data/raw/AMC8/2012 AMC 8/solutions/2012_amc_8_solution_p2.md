# 2012 AMC 8 Problem 2

## Problem

In the country of East Westmore, statisticians estimate there is a baby born every $8$ hours and a death every day. To the nearest hundred, how many people are added to the population of East Westmore each year?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}600\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}700\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}800\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}900\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}1000$

## Solution
There are $24\text{ hours}\div8\text{ hours} = 3$ births and one death everyday in East Westmore. Therefore, the population increases by $3$ - $1$ = $2$ people everyday. Thus, there are $2 \times 365 = 730$ people added to the population every year. Rounding, we find the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 700}$ .
