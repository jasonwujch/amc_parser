## Problem

What is the smallest positive integer that is neither prime nor square and that has no prime factor less than 50?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}3127\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}3133\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}3137\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}3139\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}3149$

## Solution
The problem states that the answer cannot be a perfect square or have prime factors less than $50$ . Therefore, the answer will be the product of at least two different primes greater than $50$ . The two smallest primes greater than $50$ are $53$ and $59$ . Multiplying these two primes, we obtain the number $3127$ , which is also the smallest number on the list of answer choices.
So we are done, and the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 3127}$ .
