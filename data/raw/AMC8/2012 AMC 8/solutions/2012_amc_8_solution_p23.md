## Problem

An equilateral triangle and a regular hexagon have equal perimeters. If the triangle's area is 4, what is the area of the hexagon?

$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}5\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}6\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}4\sqrt3\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}6\sqrt3$

## Solution 1
Let the perimeter of the equilateral triangle be $3s$ . The side length of the equilateral triangle would then be $s$ and the sidelength of the hexagon would be $\frac{s}{2}$ .
A hexagon contains six equilateral triangles. One of these triangles would be similar to the large equilateral triangle in the ratio $1 : 4$ , since the sidelength of the small equilateral triangle is half the side length of the large one. Thus, the area of one of the small equilateral triangles is $1$ . The area of the hexagon is then $1 \times 6 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 6}$ .

## Solution 2 (Hard)
Let the side length of the small triangle be $2x$ , so the side length of the hexagon is $x$ . By the Pythagorean theorem, the height of the triangle is $x\sqrt{3}$ , so the area of the triangle is $\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{3}}$ We are given that the area is $4$ , so x must be $\frac{2}{\sqrt[4]{3}}$ . Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, the height of one of the triangles in the hexagon (made by subdividing the hexagon into $6$ congruent triangles), is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt[4]{3}}$ , so the area is $\frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt[4]{3}}\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt[4]{3}}}{2}$ , which equals $1$ . Since there are $6$ such triangles in the hexagon, the area of the hexagon is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 6}$ .
