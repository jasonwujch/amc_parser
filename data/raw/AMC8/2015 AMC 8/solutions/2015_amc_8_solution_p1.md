# 2015 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Onkon wants to cover his room's floor with his favourite red carpet. How many square yards of red carpet are required to cover a rectangular floor that is $12$ feet long and $9$ feet wide? (There are 3 feet in a yard.)

$\textbf{(A) }12\qquad\textbf{(B) }36\qquad\textbf{(C) }108\qquad\textbf{(D) }324\qquad \textbf{(E) }972$

## Solution 1
We need $12\cdot9$ square feet of carpet to cover the floor. Since there are $9$ square feet in a square yard, we divide this by $9$ to get $\bold{\boxed{\textbf{(A) }12}}$ square yards.

## Solution 2
Since there are $3$ feet in a yard, we divide $9$ by $3$ to get $3$ yards, and $12$ by $3$ to get $4$ yards. To find the area of the carpet, we then multiply these two values together to get $3\cdot4=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }12}$ square yards.
