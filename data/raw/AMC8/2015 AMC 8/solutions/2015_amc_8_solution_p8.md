## Problem

What is the smallest whole number larger than the perimeter of any triangle with a side of length $5$ and a side of length $19$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }24\qquad\textbf{(B) }29\qquad\textbf{(C) }43\qquad\textbf{(D) }48\qquad \textbf{(E) }57$

## Solution
We know from the Triangle Inequality that the last side, $s$ , fulfills $s<5+19=24$ . Adding $5+19$ to both sides of the inequality, we get $s+5+19<48$ , and because $s+5+19$ is the perimeter of our triangle, $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 48}$ is our answer.

## Solution 2
$s$ , fulfills $s<5+19=24$ , meaning that s<24. The greatest value of s can be 23. 23+5+19 is 47. 48 is our nearest answer choice so its $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 48}$ .-TheNerdWhoIsNerdy.
