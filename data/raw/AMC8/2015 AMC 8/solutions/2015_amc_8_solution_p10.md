## Problem

How many integers between 1000 and 9999 have four distinct digits?

$\textbf{(A) }3024\qquad\textbf{(B) }4536\qquad\textbf{(C) }5040\qquad\textbf{(D) }6480\qquad \textbf{(E) }6561$

## Solution 1
There are $9$ choices for the first number, since it cannot be $0$ , there are only $9$ choices left for the second number since it must differ from the first, $8$ choices for the third number, since it must differ from the first two, and $7$ choices for the fourth number, since it must differ from all three. This means there are $9 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }4536}$ integers between $1000$ and $9999$ with four distinct digits.
If you're too lazy to do $9 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7= 4536$ , we can notice $9 \times 9 = 81$ and $8 \times 7=56$ The unit digit must be 6. Therefore the answer is the only answer with a a unit digit of 6. $\boxed{B}$ )
