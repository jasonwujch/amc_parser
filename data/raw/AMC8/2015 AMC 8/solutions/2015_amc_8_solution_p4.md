# 2015 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

The Blue Bird High School chess team consists of two boys and three girls. A photographer wants to take a picture of the team to appear in the local newspaper. She decides to have them sit in a row with a boy at each end and the three girls in the middle. How many such arrangements are possible?

$\textbf{(A) }2\qquad\textbf{(B) }4\qquad\textbf{(C) }5\qquad\textbf{(D) }6\qquad \textbf{(E) }12$

## Solution
There are $2! = 2$ ways to order the boys on the ends, and there are $3!=6$ ways to order the girls in the middle. We get the answer to be $2 \cdot 6 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }12}$ .
