# 2020 AMC 8 Problem 2

## Problem

Four friends do yardwork for their neighbors over the weekend, earning $$15, $20, $25,$ and $$40,$ respectively. They decide to split their earnings equally among themselves. In total, how much will the friend who earned $$40$ give to the others?

$\textbf{(A) }$5 \qquad \textbf{(B) }$10 \qquad \textbf{(C) }$15 \qquad \textbf{(D) }$20 \qquad \textbf{(E) }$25$

## Solution
The friends earn $$\left(15+20+25+40\right)=$100$ in total. Since they decided to split their earnings equally, it follows that each person will get $$\left(\frac{100}{4}\right)=$25$ . Since the friend who earned $$40$ will need to leave with $$25$ , he will have to give $$\left(40-25\right)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }$15}$ to the others.
