# 2020 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Luka is making lemonade to sell at a school fundraiser. His recipe requires $4$ times as much water as sugar and twice as much sugar as lemon juice. He uses $3$ cups of lemon juice. How many cups of water does he need?

$\textbf{(A) }6 \qquad \textbf{(B) }8 \qquad \textbf{(C) }12 \qquad \textbf{(D) }18 \qquad \textbf{(E) }24$

## Solution 1 (Direct)
We have $\text{water} : \text{sugar} : \text{lemon juice} = 4\cdot 2 : 2 : 1 = 8 : 2 : 1,$ so Luka needs $3 \cdot 8 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }24}$ cups.

## Solution 2 (Stepwise)
Since the amount of sugar is twice the amount of lemon juice, Luka uses $3\cdot2=6$ cups of sugar.
Since the amount of water is $4$ times the amount of sugar, he uses $6\cdot4=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }24}$ cups of water.

## Solution 3 (Combination of Solutions 1 and 2)
The ratio is $\text{Water}:\text{Sugar}:\text{Lemon Juice},$ or $8:2:1.$ Since we know that Luka used 3 cups of lemon juice, he needs $3\cdot2=6$ cups of sugar. Because the amount of water is $4$ times the amount of sugar Luka needs, he will need $6\cdot4=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }24}$ cups of water.
