## Problem

Three fourths of a pitcher is filled with pineapple juice. The pitcher is emptied by pouring an equal amount of juice into each of $5$ cups. What percent of the total capacity of the pitcher did each cup receive?

$\textbf{(A) }5 \qquad \textbf{(B) }10 \qquad \textbf{(C) }15 \qquad \textbf{(D) }20 \qquad \textbf{(E) }25$

## Solution 1
Each cup is filled with $\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{20}$ of the amount of juice in the pitcher, so the percentage is $\frac{3}{20} \cdot 100 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}$ .

## Solution 2
The pitcher is $\frac{3}{4}$ full, i.e. $75\%$ full. Therefore each cup receives $\frac{75}{5}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}$ percent of the total capacity.

## Solution 3
Assume that the pitcher has a total capacity of $100$ ounces. Since it is filled three fourths with pineapple juice, it contains $75$ ounces of pineapple juice, which means that each cup will contain $\frac{75}{5}=15$ ounces of pineapple juice. Since the total capacity of the pitcher was $100$ ounces, it follows that each cup received $15\%$ of the total capacity of the pitcher, yielding $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}$ as the answer.
