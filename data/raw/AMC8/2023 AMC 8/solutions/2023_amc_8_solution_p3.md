# 2023 AMC 8 Problem 3

## Problem

Wind chill is a measure of how cold people feel when exposed to wind outside. A good estimate for wind chill can be found using this calculation \[(\text{wind chill}) = (\text{air temperature}) - 0.7 \times (\text{wind speed}),\] where temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit $(^{\circ}\text{F})$ and the wind speed is measured in miles per hour (mph). Suppose the air temperature is $36^{\circ}\text{F}$ and the wind speed is $18$ mph. Which of the following is closest to the approximate wind chill?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 18 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 23 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 28 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 32 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 35$

## Solution
By substitution, we have \begin{align*} (\text{wind chill}) &= 36 - 0.7 \times 18 \\ &= 36 - 12.6 \\ &= 23.4 \\ &\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 23}. \end{align*} ~apex304, SohumUttamchandani, wuwang2002, TaeKim, Cxrupptedpat, MRENTHUSIASM

## Solution 2 (Estimation)
$0.7$ is very close to $\frac{2}{3}$ - therefore, we can substitute $\frac{2}{3}$ into the equation to get \[36 - \frac{2}{3} \cdot 18 = 36 - 12 = 24.\] As $\frac{2}{3}$ is slightly less than $0.7$ , the correct answer is slightly less than $24$ . Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 23}$ .

## Solution 3
0.7 is equivalent to 7/10. 7/10 times 18 is 126/10, which is 12.6. Since the air temperature is 36 degrees Fahrenheit, 36 - 12.6 is 23.4, which is the closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 23}$ .
