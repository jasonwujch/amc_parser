# 2023 AMC 8 Problem 14

## Problem

Nicolas is planning to send a package to his friend Anton, who is a stamp collector. To pay for the postage, Nicolas would like to cover the package with a large number of stamps. Suppose he has a collection of $5$ -cent, $10$ -cent, and $25$ -cent stamps, with exactly $20$ of each type. What is the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $$7.10$ in postage? (Note: The amount $$7.10$ corresponds to $7$ dollars and $10$ cents. One dollar is worth $100$ cents.)

$\textbf{(A)}\ 45 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 46 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 51 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 54\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 55$

## Solution 1
Let's use the most stamps to make $7.10.$ We have $20$ of each stamp, $5$ -cent (nickels), $10$ -cent (dimes), and $25$ -cent (quarters).
If we want the highest number of stamps, we must have the highest number of the smaller value stamps (like the coins above). We can use $20$ nickels and $20$ dimes to bring our total cost to $7.10 - 3.00 = 4.10$ . However, when we try to use quarters, the $25$ cents don’t fit evenly, so we have to give back $15$ cents to make the quarter amount $4.25$ . The most efficient way to do this is to give back a $10$ -cent (dime) stamp and a $5$ -cent (nickel) stamp to have $38$ stamps used so far. Now, we just use $\frac{425}{25} = 17$ quarters to get a grand total of $38 + 17 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 55}$ .

## Solution 2
The value of his entire stamp collection is $8$ dollars. To make $$7.10$ with stamps, he should remove $90$ cents worth of stamps with as few stamps as possible. To do this, he should start by removing as many $25$ cent stamps as possible as they have the greatest denomination. He can remove at most $3$ of these stamps. He still has to remove $90-25\cdot3=15$ cents worth of stamps. This can be done with one $5$ and $10$ cent stamp. In total, he has $20\cdot3=60$ stamps in his entire collection. As a result, the maximum number of stamps he can use is $20\cdot3-5=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 55}$ .
