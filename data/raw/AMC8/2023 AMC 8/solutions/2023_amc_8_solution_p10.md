## Problem

Harold made a plum pie to take on a picnic. He was able to eat only $\frac{1}{4}$ of the pie, and he left the rest for his friends. A moose came by and ate $\frac{1}{3}$ of what Harold left behind. After that, a porcupine ate $\frac{1}{3}$ of what the moose left behind. How much of the original pie still remained after the porcupine left?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{12} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{6} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{4} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{3} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{5}{12}$

## Solution
Note that:
More simply, we can condense the solution above into the following equation: \[\left(1-\frac14\right)\left(1-\frac13\right)\left(1-\frac13\right) = \frac34\cdot\frac23\cdot\frac23 = \frac13.\]

### Remark
This problem is a great example of the implementation of remaining portions . This concept, in short, refers to the method of finding out what remains of a whole when part of it is taken. If you look closely at our solution, we can see that the denominator is the same when we said Harold ate $\frac14$ of the pie and we got $\frac34$ of the pie left. We can also see the numerator is just the denominator minus the old denominator.
