# 2023 AMC 8 Problem 22

## Problem

In a sequence of positive integers, each term after the second is the product of the previous two terms. The sixth term is $4000$ . What is the first term?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 10$

## Solution 1
In this solution, we will use trial and error to solve. $4000$ can be expressed as $200 \times 20$ . We divide $200$ by $20$ and get $10$ , divide $20$ by $10$ and get $2$ , and divide $10$ by $2$ to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 5}$ . No one said that they have to be in ascending order!

## Solution 2
Consider the first term is $a$ and the second term is $b$ . Then, the following term will be $ab$ , $ab^2$ , $a^2b^3$ and $a^3b^5$ . Notice that $4000=2^5\times 5^3$ , then we obtain $a=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 5}$ and $b=2$ .
