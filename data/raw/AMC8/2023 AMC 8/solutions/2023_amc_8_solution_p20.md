# 2023 AMC 8 Problem 20

## Problem

Two integers are inserted into the list $3, 3, 8, 11, 28$ to double its range. The mode and median remain unchanged. What is the maximum possible sum of the two additional numbers?

$\textbf{(A) } 56 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 57 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 58 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 60 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 61$

## Solution 1
To double the range, we must find the current range, which is $28 - 3 = 25$ , to then double to: $2(25) = 50$ . Since we do not want to change the median, we need to get a value less than $8$ (as $8$ would change the mode) for the smaller, making $53$ fixed for the larger. Anything less than $3$ is not beneficial to the optimization because you want to get the largest range without changing the mode. So, taking our optimal values of $7$ and $53$ , we have an answer of $7 + 53 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 60}$ .
