## Problem

Using only pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, what is the smallest number of coins Freddie would need so he could pay any amount of money less than a dollar?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 6 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 25\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 99$

## Solution
You need $2$ dimes, $1$ nickel, and $4$ pennies for the first $25$ cents. From $26$ cents to $50$ cents, you only need to add $1$ quarter. From $51$ cents to $75$ cents, you also only need to add $1$ quarter. The same for $76$ cents to $99$ cents. Notice that instead of $100$ , it is $99$ . We are left with $3$ quarters, $1$ nickel, $2$ dimes, and $4$ pennies. Thus, the correct answer is $3+2+1+4=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10}$ .
