# 2010 AMC 8 Problem 21

## Problem

Hui is an avid reader. She bought a copy of the best seller Math is Beautiful . On the first day, Hui read $1/5$ of the pages plus $12$ more, and on the second day she read $1/4$ of the remaining pages plus $15$ pages. On the third day she read $1/3$ of the remaining pages plus $18$ pages. She then realized that there were only $62$ pages left to read, which she read the next day. How many pages are in this book?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 120 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 180\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 240\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 300\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 360$

## Solution 1(algebra solution)
Let $x$ be the number of pages in the book. After the first day, Hui had $\frac{4x}{5}-12$ pages left to read. After the second, she had $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\left(\frac{4x}{5}-12\right)-15 = \frac{3x}{5}-24$ left. After the third, she had $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{3x}{5}-24\right)-18=\frac{2x}{5}-34$ left. This is equivalent to $62.$
\begin{align*} \frac{2x}{5}-34&=62\\ 2x - 170 &= 310\\ 2x &= 480\\ x &= \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 240} \end{align*}

## Solution 2 (working backwards)
On the last day Hui read $62$ pages. Working backwards, she read $18$ pages more ( $80$ total). $80$ is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining pages, so the third morning Hui had $120$ pages to read. Add back the $15$ and you find $135$ must be $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining pages, so there were $180$ pages on the second morning. Add $12$ more, then $192$ is $\frac{4}{5}$ of the total book, which must be $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 240}$ pages long.
