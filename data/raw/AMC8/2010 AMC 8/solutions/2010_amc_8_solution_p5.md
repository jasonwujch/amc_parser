# 2010 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Alice needs to replace a light bulb located $10$ centimeters below the ceiling in her kitchen. The ceiling is $2.4$ meters above the floor. Alice is $1.5$ meters tall and can reach $46$ centimeters above the top of her head. Standing on a stool, she can just reach the light bulb. What is the height of the stool, in centimeters?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 32 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 34\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 38\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 40$

## Solution
Convert everything to the same unit. Since the answer is in centimeters, change meters to centimeters by moving the decimal place two places to the right.
The ceiling is $240$ centimeters above the floor. The combined height of Alice and the light bulb when she reaches for it is $10+150+46=206$ centimeters. That means the stool's height needs to be $240-206=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 34}$
