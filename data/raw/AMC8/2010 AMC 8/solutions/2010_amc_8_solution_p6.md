## Problem

Which of the following figures has the greatest number of lines of symmetry?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{equilateral triangle}$

$\textbf{(B)}\ \text{non-square rhombus}$

$\textbf{(C)}\ \text{non-square rectangle}$

$\textbf{(D)}\ \text{isosceles trapezoid}$

$\textbf{(E)}\ \text{square}$

## Solution
An equilateral triangle has $3$ lines of symmetry. A non-square rhombus has $2$ lines of symmetry. A non-square rectangle has $2$ lines of symmetry. An isosceles trapezoid has $1$ line of symmetry. A square has $4$ lines of symmetry.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{ \textbf{(E)}\ \text{square} }$ .
