# 2010 AMC 8 Problem 15

## Problem

A jar contains $5$ different colors of gumdrops. $30\%$ are blue, $20\%$ are brown, $15\%$ are red, $10\%$ are yellow, and other $30$ gumdrops are green. If half of the blue gumdrops are replaced with brown gumdrops, how many gumdrops will be brown?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 35\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 42\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 48\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 64$

## Solution 1
We do $100-30-20-15-10$ to find the percent of gumdrops that are green. We find that $25\%$ of the gumdrops are green. That means there are $120$ gumdrops. If we replace half of the blue gumdrops with brown gumdrops, then $15\%$ of the jar's gumdrops are brown. $\dfrac{35}{100} \cdot 120=42 \Rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 42}$

## Solution 2
We first calculate the percentage of gumdrops that are green. Subtracting all the other percentages from \(100\%\), we have: $100-30-20-15-10$ = $25\%$ .
Thus, $25\%$ of the gumdrops are green.
Next, we set up a proportion: \(\frac{30}{25\%} = \frac{x}{30\%}\) to find the number of blue gumdrops. Cross-multiplying, we solve for \(x\): 36
So there are 36 blue gumdrops.
We divide the number of blue gumdrops by 2 to get 18
Now, we calculate the number of brown marbles using the proportion:
\(\frac{30}{25\%} = \frac{y}{20\%}\),
where \(y\) is the number of brown marbles. Solving, we find y = 24.
Adding these together gives:
24 + 18 = 42.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 42}$
