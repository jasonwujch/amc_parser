# 2025 AMC 8 Problem 6

## Problem

Sekou writes the numbers $15, 16, 17, 18, 19.$ After he erases one of his numbers, the sum of the remaining four numbers is a multiple of $4.$ Which number did he erase?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 16\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 17\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 18\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 19$

## Solution 1
The sum of all five numbers is $85$ . Since $85$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $4$ , the number being subtracted must be $1$ more than a multiple of $4$ . Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~17}$ . ~Gavin_Deng

## Solution 2
The sum of the residues of these numbers modulo $4$ is $-1+0+1+2+3=5 \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ . Hence, the number being subtracted must be congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ . The only such answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~17}$ . ~cxsmi

## Solution 3
We try out every number using brute force and get $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~17}$ .
Note that this is not practical and it is very time-consuming.

## Solution 4
Since the sum of $15 + \dots + 19$ is odd, we immediately exclude B and D. We further note that if A is true, then E is true. Hence, the answer is C.

## Solution 5
We can use the fact that $(a + b) \mod n = [(a \mod n) + (b \mod n)] \mod n$ . Notice that $15, 16, 17, 18, 19$ dividing by 4 have remainders $3, 0, 1, 2, 3$ . Their sum is 9. It is easy to see that $9-1=8$ is divisible by 4 and so C (17) is the correct answer.
