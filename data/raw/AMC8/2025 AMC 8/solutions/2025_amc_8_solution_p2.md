$\textbf{(A)}\ 1,423 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 10,423 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 14,023 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 14,203 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 14,230$

## Solution 1
The first hieroglyph is worth $10,000$ , the next 4 are worth $100 \cdot 4 = 400$ , the next $2$ are worth $10 \cdot 2 = 20$ , and the last $3$ are worth $1 \cdot 3 = 3$ . Therefore, the answer is $10,000 + 400 + 20 + 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$

## Solution 2
Simply notice that the first hieroglyph represents $10,000$ , and the next ones represent $4$ hundreds. The only answer choice with a $1$ in the thousands place and a $4$ in the hundreds place is answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$

## Solution 3 (fast version of Solution 2)
From a first inspection, you may notice that there is no thousands hieroglyph. The only option with zero in the thousands place is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10,423}$
