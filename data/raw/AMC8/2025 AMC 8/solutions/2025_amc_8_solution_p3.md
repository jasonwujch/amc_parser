# 2025 AMC 8 Problem 3

## Problem

Buffalo Shuffle-o is a card game in which all the cards are distributed evenly among all players at the start of the game. When Annika and $3$ of her friends play Buffalo Shuffle-o , each player is dealt $15$ cards. Suppose $2$ more friends join the next game. How many cards will be dealt to each player?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 9 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 10 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 11 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 12$

## Solution 1
We start with Annika and $3$ of her friends playing, meaning that there are $4$ players. This must mean that there is a total of $4 \cdot 15 = 60$ cards. If $2$ more players joined, there would be $6$ players, and since the cards need to be split evenly, this would mean that each player gets $\frac{60}{6}=\boxed{\text{(C)\ 10}}$ Buffalo Shuffle-O cards each meaning that the final answer is 10.
