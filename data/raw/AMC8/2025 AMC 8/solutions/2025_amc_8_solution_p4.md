# 2025 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

Lucius is counting backward by $7$ s. His first three numbers are $100$ , $93$ , and $86$ . What is his $10$ th number?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 30 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 37 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 42 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 44 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 47$

## Solution 1
We plug $a=100, d=-7$ and $n=10$ into the formula $a+d(n-1)$ for the $n$ th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a$ and common difference is $d$ to get $100-7(10-1) = \boxed{\text{(B)\ 37}}$ .

## Solution 2
Since we want to find the $9$ th number Lucius says after he says $100$ , $7$ is subtracted from his number $9$ times, so our answer is $100-(9 \cdot 7) = \boxed{\text{(B)\ 37}}$

## Solution 3
Using brute force and counting backward by $7$ s, we have $100, 93, 86, 79, 72, 65, 58, 51, 44, \boxed{\text{(B)\ 37}}$ .
Note that this solution is not practical and very time-consuming.

## Solution 4
This can be thought of as an arithmetic sequence. Knowing that our first term is $100$ , we have to add $7$ to get to our 0th term, $107$ . Our answer is then $107 - 10 \cdot 7 = \boxed{\text{(B)\ 37}}$ .
