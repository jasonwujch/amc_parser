## Problem

How many four-digit numbers have all three of the following properties?

(I) The tens and ones digit are both 9.

(II) The number is 1 less than a perfect square.

(III) The number is the product of exactly two prime numbers.

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 4$

## Solution 1
The Condition (II) perfect square must end in " $00$ " because $...99+1=...00$ Condition (I) . Four-digit perfect squares ending in " $00$ " are ${40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90}$ .
Condition (II) also says the number is in the form $n^2-1$ . By the Difference of Squares , $n^2-1 = (n+1)(n-1)$ . Hence:
On this list, the only number that is the product of $2$ prime numbers is $60^2-1 = (59)(61)$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)\ 1}}$ .
