## Problem

Isaiah cuts open a cardboard cube along some of its edges to form the flat shape shown on the right, which has an area of $18$ square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube in cubic centimeters?

$\textbf{(A)}~3\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(B)}~6 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~9 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~6\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(E)}~9\sqrt{3}$

## Solution 1
Each of the $6$ faces of the cube have equal area, so the area of each face is equal to $\frac{18}{6} = 3$ , making the side length $\sqrt3$ . From this, we can see that the volume of the cube is $\sqrt{3}^3 = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}~3\sqrt{3}}$

## Solution 2
Let the side length of the cube shown be equal to $s$ centimeters. The surface area of this cube is equal to the area of the net of the cube, which is equal to $18$ square centimeters. The surface area of this cube is also $6s^2$ square centimeters, so we have \[6s^2 = 18 \implies s^2 = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \implies s = \sqrt{3}.\] However, we aren't done. We have found that the side length of the cube is $\sqrt{3} cm$ , but the question asks for the volume of the cube, which is equal to $s^3 = \sqrt{3}^3 = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}~3\sqrt{3}}$ cubic centimeters.
