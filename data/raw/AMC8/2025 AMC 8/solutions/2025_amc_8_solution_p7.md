## Problem

On the most recent exam on Prof. Xochi's class,

$5$ students earned a score of at least $95\%$ ,

$13$ students earned a score of at least $90\%$ ,

$27$ students earned a score of at least $85\%$ ,

$50$ students earned a score of at least $80\%$ ,

How many students earned a score of at least $80\%$ and less than $90\%$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 8\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 14\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 22\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 37\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 45$

## Solution 1
$50$ people scored at least $80\%$ , and out of these $50$ people, $13$ of them earned a score that was not less than $90\%$ , so the number of people that scored in between at least $80\%$ and less than $90\%$ is $50-13 = \boxed{\text{(D)\ 37}}$ .

## Solution 2
Let $a$ denote the number of people who had a score of at least $85$ , but less than $90$ , and let $b$ denote the number of people who had a score of at least $80$ but less than $85$ . Our answer is equal to $a+b$ . We find $a = 27 - 13 = 14$ , while $b = 50 - 27 = 23$ . Thus, the answer is $23 + 14 = \boxed{\text{(D)\ 37}}$ .
