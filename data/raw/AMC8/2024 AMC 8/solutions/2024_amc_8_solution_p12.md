## Problem

Rohan keeps 90 guppies in 4 fish tanks.

How many guppies are in the 4th tank?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 20 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 21 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 23 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 24 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 26$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ denote the number of guppies in the first tank.
Then, we have the following for the number of guppies in the rest of the tanks:
The number of guppies in all of the tanks combined is 90, so we can write the equation
\[(x)+(x+1)+(x+1+2)+(x+1+2+3) = 90.\]
Simplifying the equation gives
\[4x + 10 = 90.\]
Solving the resulting equation gives $x = 20$ , so the number of guppies in the fourth tank is $20+1+2+3 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 26}$ .

## Solution 2
Suppose there are no guppies in the first tank. Then, the number of guppies in the other tanks are $1,3,$ and $6,$ or $10$ guppies in total. We need to add $90-10 = 80$ guppies into $4$ tanks or $20$ guppies in each tank, so the number of guppies in the fourth tank is $20+6 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 26}.$
