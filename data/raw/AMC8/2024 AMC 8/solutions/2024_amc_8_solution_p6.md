# 2024 AMC 8 Problem 6

## Problem

Sergai skated around an ice rink, gliding along different paths. The gray lines in the figures below show four of the paths labeled P, Q, R, and S. What is the sorted order of the four paths from shortest to longest?

$\textbf{(A)}\ P,Q,R,S \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ P,R,S,Q \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ Q,S,P,R \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ R,P,S,Q \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ R,S,P,Q$

## Solution 1
You can measure the lengths of the paths until you find a couple of guaranteed true inferred statements as such: $Q$ is greater than $S$ , $P$ is greater than $R$ , and $R$ and $P$ are the smallest two, therefore the order is $R, P, S, Q.$ Thus we get the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~R, P, S, Q}$ .

## Solution 2 (Intuitive)
Obviously Path Q is the longest path, followed by Path S.
So, it is down to Paths P and R.
Notice that curved lines are always longer than the straight ones that meet their endpoints, therefore Path P is longer than Path R.
Thus, the order from shortest to longest is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \text{R, P, S, Q}}$ .
