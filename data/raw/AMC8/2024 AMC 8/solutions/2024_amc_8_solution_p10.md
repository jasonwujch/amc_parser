## Problem

In January $1980$ the Mauna Loa Observatory recorded carbon dioxide $(CO2)$ levels of $338$ ppm (parts per million). Over the years the average $CO2$ reading has increased by about $1.515$ ppm each year. What is the expected $CO2$ level in ppm in January $2030$ ? Round your answer to the nearest integer.

$\textbf{(A)}\ 399\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 414\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 420\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 444\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 459$

## Solution 1
This is a time period of $2030 - 1980 = 50$ years, so we can expect the ppm to increase by $50*1.515=75.75\approx 76$ ppm. Since we started with $338$ ppm, we have $76+338=\boxed{\textbf{(B)\ 414}}$ .

## Solution 2
$2030 - 1980 = 50$ years. The ppm level in 2030 is $338 + 50 * 1.515 = 338 + 75.75 = 413.75$ $\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)\ 414}}$ .
