# 2024 AMC 8 Problem 15

## Problem

Let the letters $F$ , $L$ , $Y$ , $B$ , $U$ , $G$ represent distinct digits. Suppose $\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}~\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}$ is the greatest number that satisfies the equation

\[8\cdot\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}~\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}=\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G}~\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G}.\]

What is the value of $\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}+\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1089 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 1098 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 1107 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 1116 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 1125$

## Solution 1
The highest that $FLYFLY$ can be would have to be $124124$ , and it cannot be higher than that, because then it would be $125125$ , and $125125$ multiplied by 8 is $1001000$ , and then it would exceed the $6$ - digit limit set on $BUGBUG$ .
So, if we start at $124124\cdot8$ , we get $992992$ , which would be wrong because both $B \& U$ would be $9$ , and the numbers cannot be repeated between different letters.
If we move on to the next highest, $123123$ , and multiply by $8$ , we get $984984$ . All the digits are different, so $FLY+BUG$ would be $123+984$ , which is $1107$ . So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}1107}$ .

## Solution 2
Notice that $\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}~\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y} = 1000(\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}) + \underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}$ .
Likewise, $\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G}~\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G} = 1000(\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G}) + \underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G}$ .
Therefore, we have the following equation:
$8 \times 1001(\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}) = 1001(\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G})$ .
Simplifying the equation gives
$8(\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}) = (\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G})$ .
We can now use our equation to test each answer choice.
We have that $123123 \times 8 = 984984$ , so we can find the sum:
$\underline{F}~\underline{L}~\underline{Y}+\underline{B}~\underline{U}~\underline{G} = 123 + 984 = 1107$ .
So, the correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 1107}$ .
- C. Re

## Solution 3 (Answer Choices)
Note that $FLY+BUG = 9 \cdot FLY$ . Thus, we can check the answer choices and find $FLY$ through each of the answer choices, we find the 1107 works, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 1107}$ .

## Solution 4
To solve \( 8 \cdot FLY = BUG \) without guessing, we start by noting that \( FLY \) and \( BUG \) are three-digit numbers with distinct digits. We can write \( FLY = 100F + 10L + Y \) and \( BUG = 100B + 10U + G \), so the equation becomes:
\(8 \cdot (100 \cdot F + 10 \cdot L + Y) = 100 \cdot B + 10 \cdot U + G \)
Since \( 8 \cdot FLY \) must also be a three-digit number, \( FLY \) must be small, specifically \( 100 \leq FLY \leq 124 \), because \( 8 \cdot 124 = 992 \) (just under $1000$ ). We try \( F = 1 \) (since \( FLY \) must remain three digits), which gives \( B = 8F = 8 \), leading to \( FLY = 123 \) and \( BUG = 8 \cdot 123 = 984 \), where all digits \( 1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 4 \) are distinct. Adding \( FLY + BUG = 123 + 984 = 1107 \), the final answer is \(\boxed{\text{(C) } 1107} \).
