## Problem

All the marbles in Maria's collection are red, green, or blue. Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, and twice as many blue marbles as green marbles. Which of the following could be the total number of marbles in Maria's collection?

$\textbf{(A) } 24\qquad\textbf{(B) } 25\qquad\textbf{(C) } 26\qquad\textbf{(D) } 27\qquad\textbf{(E) } 28$

## Solution 1
Since she has half as many red marbles as green, we can call the number of red marbles $x$ , and the number of green marbles $2x$ . Since she has half as many green marbles as blue, we can call the number of blue marbles $4x$ . Adding them up, we have: $7x$ marbles. The number of marbles therefore must be a multiple of $7$ , as $x$ represents an integer, so the only possible answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) 28}}.$

## Solution 2
Suppose Maria has $g$ green marbles and $t$ total marbles. She then has $\frac{g}{2}$ red marbles and $2g$ blue marbles. Altogether, Maria has \[g + \frac{g}{2} + 2g = \frac{7g}{2} = t\] marbles, so $g = \dfrac{2t}{7},$ so $t$ must be a multiple of $7$ . The only multiple of $7$ in the answer choices is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) 28}}.$

## Solution 3
This solution is similar to Solution 1. The most simplest and effective way to solve this problem is equations. We have the following equations:
2r=g and 2g=b We essentialy want to find out the total number of mables in Maria's collection or in equation terms (r+g+b). Converting that equation and substituting the values we get r+2r+4r=7r Now, we know the total is a multiple of 7 leaving our answer as $\boxed{\textbf{(E) 28}}.$ -AADHYA2012
