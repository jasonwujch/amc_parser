# 2024 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice. She notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of $6$ . Which of the following integers cannot be the sum of the two numbers?

$\textbf{(A) } 5\qquad\textbf{(B) } 6\qquad\textbf{(C) } 7\qquad\textbf{(D) } 8\qquad\textbf{(E) } 9$

## Solution 1
First, figure out all pairs of numbers whose product is 6. Then, using the process of elimination, we can find the following:
$\textbf{(A)}$ is possible: $2\times 3$
$\textbf{(C)}$ is possible: $1\times 6$
$\textbf{(D)}$ is possible: $2\times 6$
The only integer that cannot be the sum is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 6}$ .

## Solution 2
First, see that in order for the two numbers to have a product of 6, it must either have 6 as a factor or have factors that have a product of 6 (Notably $2\times 3$ ).
When we look at the answer choices, we see that answers $C, D, E$ all are more than 6, so they can all be added as a sum of 6. Answer $A$ works because $2+3=5$ , so 6 is the only answer choice that doesn't work. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 6}$ .
