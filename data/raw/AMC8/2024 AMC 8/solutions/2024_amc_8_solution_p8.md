# 2024 AMC 8 Problem 8

## Problem

On Monday, Taye has $$2$ . Every day, he either gains $$3$ or doubles the amount of money he had on the previous day. How many different dollar amounts could Taye have on Thursday, $3$ days later?

$\textbf{(A) } 3\qquad\textbf{(B) } 4\qquad\textbf{(C) } 5\qquad\textbf{(D) } 6\qquad\textbf{(E) } 7$

## Solution 1
How many dollar values could be on the first day? Only $2$ dollars. The second day, you can either add $3$ dollars, or double, so you can have $5$ dollars, or $4$ . For each of these values, you have $2$ values for each. For $5$ dollars, you have $10$ dollars or $8$ , and for $4$ dollars, you have $8$ dollars or $7$ dollars. Now, you have $2$ values for each of these. For $10$ dollars, you have $13$ dollars or $20$ , for $8$ dollars, you have $16$ dollars or $11$ , for $8$ dollars, you have $16$ dollars or $11$ , and for $7$ dollars, you have $14$ dollars or $10$ .
On the final day, there are 11, 11, 16, and 16 repeating, leaving you with $8-2 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)\ 6}}$ different values.

## Solution 2
Continue as in Solution 1 to get $7$ , $8$ , or $10$ dollars by the 2nd day. The only way to get the same dollar amount occurring twice by branching (multiply by $2$ or adding $3$ ) from here is if $7+3=10\cdot 2$ or $7+3=8\cdot 2$ which both aren't true. Hence our answer is $3\cdot2=\boxed{\textbf{(D)\ 6}}$ .

## Solution 3 (Brute Force)
Let $a$ represent Taye adding $3$ dollars and $d$ represent Taye doubling his money. We can list out all the possibilities: $a$ => $a$ => $a$ = $11$ , $a$ => $a$ => $d$ = $16$ , $a$ => $d$ => $a$ = $12$ , $a$ => $d$ => $d$ = $20$ , $d$ => $a$ => $a$ = $10$ , $d$ => $a$ => $d$ = $14$ , $d$ => $d$ => $a$ = $11$ , $d$ => $d$ => $d$ = $16$ . The unique values are $10,11,12,14,16,20$ . Thus, our desired answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)\ 6}}$
