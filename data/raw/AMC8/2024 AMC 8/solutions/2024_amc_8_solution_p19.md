## Problem

Jordan owns 15 pairs of sneakers. Three fifths of the pairs are red and the rest are white. Two thirds of the pairs are high-top and the rest are low-top. The red high-top sneakers make up a fraction of the collection. What is the least possible value of this fraction?

$\textbf{(A) } 0\qquad\textbf{(B) } \dfrac{1}{5} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \dfrac{4}{15} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \dfrac{1}{3} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \dfrac{2}{5}$

## Solution 1
Jordan has $10$ high top sneakers, and $6$ white sneakers. We would want as many white high-top sneakers as possible, so we set $6$ high-top sneakers to be white. Then, we have $10-6=4$ red high-top sneakers, so the answer is $\boxed{\dfrac{4}{15}}.$

## Solution 2
We first start by finding the amount of red and white sneakers. 3/5 * 15=9 red sneakers, so 6 are white sneakers. Then 2/3 * 15=10 are high top sneakers, so 5 are low top sneakers. Now think about 15 slots and the first 10 are labeled high top sneakers. if we insert the last 5 sneakers as red sneakers there are 4 leftover over red sneakers. Putting those four sneakers as high top sneakers we have our answer as C, or $\boxed{\dfrac{4}{15}}.$

## Solution 3
There are $\dfrac{3}{5}\cdot 15 = 9$ red pairs of sneakers and $6$ white pairs. There are also $\dfrac{2}{3}\cdot 15 = 10$ high-top pairs of sneakers and $5$ low-top pairs. Let $r$ be the number of red high-top sneakers and let $w$ be the number of white high-top sneakers. It follows that there are $9-r$ red pairs of low-top sneakers and $6-r$ white pairs. \\\\ We must have $9-r \leq 5,$ in order to have a valid amount of white sneakers. Solving this inequality gives $r\geq 4$ , so the smallest possible value for $r$ is $4$ . This means that there would be $9-4=5$ pairs of low-top red sneakers, so there are $0$ pairs of low-top white sneakers and $6$ pairs of high top white sneakers. This checks out perfectly, so the smallest fraction is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{4}{15}}.$

## Solution 4
15 times $\tfrac{3}{5}$ is $9$ , which is the number of red pairs of sneakers. Then, $\tfrac{2}{3}$ times $15$ is $10$ , so there are ten pairs of high-top sneakers. If there are ten high-top sneakers, there are five low top sneakers. To have the lowest amount of high-top red sneakers, all five of the low-top sneakers need to be red. There are four red sneakers remaining so they have to be high-top. So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{4}{15}}.$
