# 2024 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

When Yunji added all the integers from $1$ to $9$ , she mistakenly left out a number. Her incorrect sum turned out to be a square number. What number did Yunji leave out?

$\textbf{(A) } 5\qquad\textbf{(B) } 6\qquad\textbf{(C) } 7\qquad\textbf{(D) } 8\qquad\textbf{(E) } 9$

## Solution
Adding numbers 1 through 9 gives us 45. This was her expected sum, but what she got was a perfect square. Since she got that perfect square sum by forgetting a number, that sum is less than 45. The square number right under 45 is 36. So 45 - 36 = 9. So the solution is E[9].
