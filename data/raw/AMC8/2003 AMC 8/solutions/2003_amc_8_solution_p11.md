## Problem

Business is a little slow at Lou's Fine Shoes, so Lou decides to have a sale. On Friday, Lou increases all of Thursday's prices by $10$ percent. Over the weekend, Lou advertises the sale: "Ten percent off the listed price. Sale starts Monday." How much does a pair of shoes cost on Monday that cost $40$ dollars on Thursday?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 39.60\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 40\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 40.40\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 44$

## Solution
On Friday, the shoes would cost $40 \cdot 1.1= 44$ dollars. Then on Monday, the shoes would cost $44- \frac{44}{10}=44-4.4=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 39.60}$ .
