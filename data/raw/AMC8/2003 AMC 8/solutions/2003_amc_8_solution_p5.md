# 2003 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

If $20\%$ of a number is $12$ , what is $30\%$ of the same number?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 18\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 24\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 30$

## Solution
$20\%$ of a number is equal to $\frac{1}{5}$ of that number. Let $n$ =the number
$\frac{1}{5}n = 12$ Multiply both sides by 5
$n = 60$
$30\%$ of $n$ is equal to $\frac{3}{10}n = \frac{3}{10}\cdot60 = 3\cdot6 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}18}$
