# 2003 AMC 8 Problem 20

## Problem

What is the measure of the acute angle formed by the hands of the clock at 4:20 PM?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 10 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 12$

## Solution 1
Imagine the clock as a circle. The minute hand will be at the 4 at 20 minutes past the hour. The central angle formed between $4$ and $5$ is $30$ degrees (since it is 1/12 of a full circle, 360). By $4:20$ , the hour hand would have moved $\frac{1}{3}$ way from 4 to 5 since $\frac{20}{60}$ is reducible to $\frac{1}{3}$ . One third of the way from 4 to 5 is one third of 30 degrees, which is 10 degrees past the 4. Recall that the minute hand is at the 4, so the angle between them is $\boxed{(D) 10}$ .
