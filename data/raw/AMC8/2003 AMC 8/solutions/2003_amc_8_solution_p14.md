# 2003 AMC 8 Problem 14

## Problem

In this addition problem, each letter stands for a different digit.

$\setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.5mm}\begin{array}{cccc}&T & W & O\\ +&T & W & O\\ \hline F& O & U & R\end{array}$

If T = 7 and the letter O represents an even number, what is the only possible value for W?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 4$

## Solution
Since both T's are 7, then O has to equal 4, because 7 + 7 = 14. Then, F has to equal 1. To get R, we do 4 + 4 (since O = 4) to get R = 8. The value for W then has to be a number less than 5, otherwise it will change the value of O, and can't be a number that has already been used, like 4 or 1. The only other possibilities are 2 and 3. 2 doesn't work because it makes U = 4, which is what O already equals. So, the only possible value of W is 3 $\boxed{\text{D}}$
