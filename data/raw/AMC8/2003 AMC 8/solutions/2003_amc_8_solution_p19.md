## Problem

How many integers between 1000 and 2000 have all three of the numbers 15, 20, and 25 as factors?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution 1
Find the least common multiple of $15, 20, 25$ by turning the numbers into their prime factorization. \[15 = 3 * 5, 20 = 2^2 * 5, 25 = 5^2\] Gather all necessary multiples $3, 2^2, 5^2$ when multiplied gets $300$ . The multiples of $300 - 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100$ . The number of multiples between 1000 and 2000 is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3}$ .
