# 2009 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Bridget bought a bag of apples at the grocery store. She gave half of the apples to Ann. Then she gave Cassie 3 apples, keeping 4 apples for herself. How many apples did Bridget buy?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 7\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 11\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 14$

## Solution
If we set up an equation, we find out $x=(3+4)\cdot 2$ because 3 apples were left after giving half, then four away. We can simplify the equations to $x=7\cdot 2=14.$ The answer is $\text{(E) } 14.$

## Solution 2
You can work backwards and add 3 apples that she gave to Cassie to the 4 she currently has, which results in 7, and then multiply by 2 since she gave half the apples to Ann, resulting in $\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 14$ . ~Anabel.disher
