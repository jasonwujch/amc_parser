## Problem

The length of a rectangle is increased by $10\%$ percent and the width is decreased by $10\%$ percent. What percent of the old area is the new area?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 90 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 99 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 100 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 101 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 110$

## Solution
In a rectangle with dimensions $10 \times 10$ , the new rectangle would have dimensions $11 \times 9$ . The ratio of the new area to the old area is $99/100 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 99}$ .

## Solution 2
If you take the length as $x$ and the width as $y$ then A(OLD)= $xy$ A(NEW)= $1.1x\times.9y$ = $.99xy$ $0.99/1=99\%$
