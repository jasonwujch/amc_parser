## Problem

A three-digit integer contains one of each of the digits $1$ , $3$ , and $5$ . What is the probability that the integer is divisible by $5$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{6} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{3} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{2} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{2}{3} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{5}{6}$

## Solution 1
The three digit numbers are $135,153,351,315,513,531$ . The numbers that end in $5$ are divisible are $5$ , and the probability of choosing those numbers is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac13}$ .

## Solution 2
The number is divisible by 5 if and only if the number ends in $5$ (also $0$ , but that case can be ignored, as none of the digits are $0$ ) If we randomly arrange the three digits, the probability of the last digit being $5$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac13}$ .
Note: The last sentence is true because there are $3$ randomly-arrangeable numbers)
