# 2009 AMC 8 Problem 6

## Problem

Steve's empty swimming pool will hold $24,000$ gallons of water when full. It will be filled by $4$ hoses, each of which supplies $2.5$ gallons of water per minute. How many hours will it take to fill Steve's pool?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 40 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 42 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 44 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 46 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 48$

## Solution
Each of the four hoses hose fills $24,000/4 = 6,000$ gallons of water. At the rate it goes at it will take $6,000/2.5 = 2400$ minutes, or $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 40}$ hours.

## Solution 2
If all four hoses fill $2.5$ gallons a minute, every minute $10$ gallons would be added. Since every hour has $60$ minutes, $600$ gallons of water would be added every hour. $24000/600=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 40}$ hours.
