## Problem

On the last day of school, Mrs. Wonderful gave jelly beans to her class. She gave each boy as many jelly beans as there were boys in the class. She gave each girl as many jelly beans as there were girls in the class. She brought $400$ jelly beans, and when she finished, she had six jelly beans left. There were two more boys than girls in her class. How many students were in her class?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 26\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 28\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 32\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 34$

## Solution 1(Algebraic)
If there are $x$ girls, then there are $x+2$ boys. She gave each girl $x$ jellybeans and each boy $x+2$ jellybeans, for a total of $x^2 + (x+2)^2$ jellybeans. She gave away $400-6=394$ jellybeans.
\begin{align*} x^2+(x+2)^2 &= 394\\ x^2+x^2+4x+4 &= 394\\ 2x^2 + 4x &= 390\\ x^2 + 2x &= 195\\ \end{align*}
From here, we can see that $x = 13$ as $13^2 + 26 = 195$ , so there are $13$ girls, $13+2=15$ boys, and $13+15=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 28}$ students.

## Solution 2(Answer Choices)
We can use the answer choices to our advantage; we can take the number of girls as $x$ , and the number of boys as $x+2$ . If we test out $(A)$ , $x$ is 12, and $x+2$ is 14. $400-6=394$ jellybeans were given out, but $12^2+14^2$ is not equal to $394$ . Thus, $(A)$ is not the answer. Next, we try $(B)$ . $x$ is 13, $x+2$ is 15. We see that $13^2+15^2=394$ , so there are $13+15=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 28}$ students.
