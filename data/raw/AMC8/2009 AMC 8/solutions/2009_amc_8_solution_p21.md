# 2009 AMC 8 Problem 21

## Problem

Andy and Bethany have a rectangular array of numbers with $40$ rows and $75$ columns. Andy adds the numbers in each row. The average of his $40$ sums is $A$ . Bethany adds the numbers in each column. The average of her $75$ sums is $B$ . What is the value of $\frac{A}{B}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{64}{225} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{8}{15} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{15}{8} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{225}{64}$

## Solution
Note that $40A=75B=\text{sum of the numbers in the array}$ . This means that $\frac{A}{B}=\boxed{\text{(D) } \frac{15}{8}}$ using basic algebraic manipulation.
