## Problem

On average, for every 4 sports cars sold at the local dealership, 7 sedans are sold. The dealership predicts that it will sell 28 sports cars next month. How many sedans does it expect to sell?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 7\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 32\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 35\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 49\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 112$

## Solution
This means the ratio is $4:7$ . If the ratio now is $28:x$ , then that means $x= \boxed{\textbf{(D) }49}$ .
