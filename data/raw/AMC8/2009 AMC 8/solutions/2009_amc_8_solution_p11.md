# 2009 AMC 8 Problem 11

## Problem

The Amaco Middle School bookstore sells pencils costing a whole number of cents. Some seventh graders each bought a pencil, paying a total of $1.43$ dollars. Some of the $30$ sixth graders each bought a pencil, and they paid a total of $1.95$ dollars. How many more sixth graders than seventh graders bought a pencil?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution
Because the pencil costs a whole number of cents, the cost must be a factor of both $143$ and $195$ . They can be factored into $11\cdot13$ and $3\cdot5\cdot13$ . The common factor cannot be $1$ or there would have to be more than $30$ sixth graders, so the pencil costs $13$ cents. The difference in costs that the sixth and seventh graders paid is $195-143=52$ cents, which is equal to $52/13 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4}$ sixth graders.
