## Problem

Anna and Bella are celebrating their birthdays together. Five years ago, when Bella turned $6$ years old, she received a newborn kitten as a birthday present. Today the sum of the ages of the two children and the kitten is $30$ years. How many years older than Bella is Anna?

$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 2 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 4 \qquad \textbf{(E) } ~5$

## Solution
Five years ago, Bella was $6$ years old, and the kitten was $0$ years old.
Today, Bella is $11$ years old, and the kitten is $5$ years old. It follows that Anna is $30-11-5=14$ years old.
Therefore, Anna is $14-11=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 3}$ years older than Bella.
