# 2022 AMC 8 Problem 17

## Problem

If $n$ is an even positive integer, the $\emph{double factorial}$ notation $n!!$ represents the product of all the even integers from $2$ to $n$ . For example, $8!! = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8$ . What is the units digit of the following sum? \[2!! + 4!! + 6!! + \cdots + 2018!! + 2020!! + 2022!!\]

$\textbf{(A) } 0\qquad\textbf{(B) } 2\qquad\textbf{(C) } 4\qquad\textbf{(D) } 6\qquad\textbf{(E) } 8$

## Solution 1
Notice that once $n>8,$ the units digit of $n!!$ will be $0$ because there will be a factor of $10.$ Thus, we only need to calculate the units digit of \[2!!+4!!+6!!+8!! = 2+8+48+48\cdot8.\] We only care about units digits, so we have $2+8+8+8\cdot8,$ which has the same units digit as $2+8+8+4.$ The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}.$

## Solution 2 (Solution 1 worded differently)
We can see that after $8!!$ in the sequence, the units digit is always $0$ (every value after $8!!$ is a multiple of $10$ ). Therefore, our answer is the sum of the units digits of $2!!, 4!!, 6!!,$ and $8!!$ respectively. This sum is equal to $2 + 8 + 8 + 4$ , or $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 2}.$
