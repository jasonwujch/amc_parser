# 2014 AMC 8 Problem 21

## Problem

The $7$ -digit numbers $\underline{7} \underline{4} \underline{A} \underline{5} \underline{2} \underline{B} \underline{1}$ and $\underline{3} \underline{2} \underline{6} \underline{A} \underline{B} \underline{4} \underline{C}$ are each multiples of $3$ . Which of the following could be the value of $C$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }1\qquad\textbf{(B) }2\qquad\textbf{(C) }3\qquad\textbf{(D) }5\qquad \textbf{(E) }8$

## Solution 2
Since both numbers are divisible by 3, the sum of their digits has to be divisible by three. $7 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 19$ . To be a multiple of $3$ , $A + B$ has to be either $2$ or $5$ or $8$ ... and so on. We add up the numerical digits in the second number; $3 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 15$ . We then add two of the selected values, $5$ to $15$ , to get $20$ . We then see that C = $1, 4$ or $7, 10$ ... and so on, otherwise the number will not be divisible by three. We then add $8$ to $15$ , to get $23$ , which shows us that C = $1$ or $4$ or $7$ ... and so on. To be a multiple of three, we select a few of the common numbers we got from both these equations, which could be $1, 4,$ and $7$ . However, in the answer choices, there is no $7$ or $4$ or anything greater than $7$ , but there is a $1$ , so $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1}$ is our answer. Also, you could just look up the answer. It’s much easier and totally isn’t wrong in any way. :)

## Concept Solution
for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In the number 74A52B1, 7+4+A+5+2+B+1 must be divisible by 3. We get 19+A+B. 21 is the closest multiple of 3 meaning that A=2, B=0, order doesn't matter. Now we plug in those values for 326AB4C. It will be 3+2+6+2+0+4+C to get 17+C. The closest multiple of 3 is 18. So that means 17+C=18. Solving for C, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1}$ -TheNerdWhoIsNerdy.

## Solution 3 (mod)
If $n$ is divisible by $3$ , the sum of it's digits should also be divisible by $3$ . This means that $19+A+B (\mod 3) \equiv 0$ or $A+B+1 (\mod 3) \equiv 0$ . For equation $2$ , $15+A+B+C (\mod 3) \equiv 0$ or $A+B+C (\mod 3) \equiv 0$ . Logically, you can see the correlation between our first and second equations so we can make the assumption, $C =\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1}$ ~RandomMathGuy500
