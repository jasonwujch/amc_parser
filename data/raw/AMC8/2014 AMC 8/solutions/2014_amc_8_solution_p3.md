# 2014 AMC 8 Problem 3

## Problem

Isabella had a week to read a book for a school assignment. She read an average of $36$ pages per day for the first three days and an average of $44$ pages per day for the next three days. She then finished the book by reading $10$ pages on the last day. How many pages were in the book?

$\textbf{(A) }240\qquad\textbf{(B) }250\qquad\textbf{(C) }260\qquad\textbf{(D) }270\qquad \textbf{(E) }280$

## Solution
Isabella read $3\cdot 36+3\cdot 44$ pages in the first 6 days. Although this can be calculated directly, it is simpler to calculate it as $3\cdot (36+44)=3\cdot 80$ , which gives that she read $240$ pages. On her last day, she read $10$ more pages for a total of $240+10=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~250}$ pages.
