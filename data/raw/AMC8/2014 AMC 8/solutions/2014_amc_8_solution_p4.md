# 2014 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

The sum of two prime numbers is $85$ . What is the product of these two prime numbers?

$\textbf{(A) }85\qquad\textbf{(B) }91\qquad\textbf{(C) }115\qquad\textbf{(D) }133\qquad \textbf{(E) }166$

## Solution
Since the two prime numbers sum to an odd number, one of them must be even. The only even prime number is $2$ . The other prime number is $85-2=83$ , and the product of these two numbers is $83\cdot2=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~166}$ .
