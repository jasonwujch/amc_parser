# 2014 AMC 8 Problem 8

## Problem

Eleven members of the Middle School Math Club each paid the same amount for a guest speaker to talk about problem solving at their math club meeting. They paid their guest speaker $\textdollar\underline{1} \underline{A} \underline{2}$ . What is the missing digit $A$ of this $3$ -digit number?

$\textbf{(A) }0\qquad\textbf{(B) }1\qquad\textbf{(C) }2\qquad\textbf{(D) }3\qquad \textbf{(E) }4$

## Solution 1
Since all the eleven members paid the same amount, that means that the total must be divisible by $11$ . We can do some trial-and-error to get $A=3$ , so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~3}$ ~SparklyFlowers

## Solution 2
We know that a number is divisible by $11$ if the odd digits added together minus the even digits added together (or vice versa) is a multiple of $11$ . Thus, we have $1+2-A$ = a multiple of $11$ . The only multiple that works here is $0$ , as $11 \cdot 0 = 0$ . Thus, $A = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}~3}$ ~fn106068

## Solution 3
If you know your multiplication tables up to $12*12$ , you know that the out of the choices provided, the only number with $1A2$ that is divisible by $11$ is $132$ or $12*11$ . So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~3}$ . ~Jupiter10
