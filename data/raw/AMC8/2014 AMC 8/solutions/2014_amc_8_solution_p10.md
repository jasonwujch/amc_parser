# 2014 AMC 8 Problem 10

## Problem

The first AMC $8$ was given in $1985$ and it has been given annually since that time. Samantha turned $12$ years old the year that she took the seventh AMC $8$ . In what year was Samantha born?

$\textbf{(A) }1979\qquad\textbf{(B) }1980\qquad\textbf{(C) }1981\qquad\textbf{(D) }1982\qquad \textbf{(E) }1983$

## Solution 1
The seventh AMC 8 would have been given in $1991$ . If Samantha was 12 then, that means she was born 12 years ago, so she was born in $1991-12=1979$ .
Our answer is $\boxed{(\text{A})1979}$ corrections made by DrDominic

## Solution 2
Since she was 12 when she took the seventh AMC 8, she should be $12-6=6$ years old when the first AMC 8 occurred. Therefore, she was born or was 'age 0' in $1985-6=\boxed{\left(\text{A}\right)1979}$ ~SweetMango77 corrections made by DrDominic
