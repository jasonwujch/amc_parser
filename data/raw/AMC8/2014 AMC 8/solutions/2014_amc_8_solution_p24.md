## Solution
In order to maximize the median, we need to make the first half of the numbers as small as possible. Since there are $100$ people, the median will be the average of the $50\text{th}$ and $51\text{st}$ largest amount of cans per person. To minimize the first $49$ , they would each have one can. Subtracting these $49$ cans from the $252$ cans gives us $203$ cans left to divide among $51$ people. Taking $\frac{203}{51}$ gives us $3$ and a remainder of $50$ . Seeing this, the largest number of cans the $50$ th person could have is $3$ , which leaves $4$ to the rest of the people. The average of $3$ and $4$ is $3.5$ . Thus our answer is $\boxed{\text{(C) }3.5}$ .
