## Solution
Since $n^2+m^2$ is even, either both $n^2$ and $m^2$ are even, or they are both odd. Therefore, $n$ and $m$ are either both even or both odd, since the square of an even number is even and the square of an odd number is odd. As a result, $n+m$ must be even. The answer, then, is $n^2+m^2$ $\boxed{(\text{D})}$ is odd.

## Solution 2
We can assign values of n and m as 1,3. Then 1^2 $+ 3^2$ is 10. We can also assign values of n and m to be even, like 2 and 4. After calculating, we can determine that $n^2$ + $m^2$ could be odd or even. Then, we can conclude that n+m is not odd. Hence our answer choice is $\boxed{(\text{D})}$ -TheNerdWhoIsNerdy.
