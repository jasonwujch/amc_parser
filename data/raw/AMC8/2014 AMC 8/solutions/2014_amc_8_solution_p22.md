## Solution
We can think of the number as $10a+b$ , where a is the tens digit and b is the unit digit. Since the number is equal to the product of the digits ( $ab$ ) plus the sum of the digits ( $a+b$ ), we can say that $10a+b=ab+a+b$ . We can simplify this to $10a=ab+a$ , which factors to $(10)a=(b+1)a$ . Dividing by $a$ , we have that $b+1=10$ . Therefore, the units digit, $b$ , is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }9}$
