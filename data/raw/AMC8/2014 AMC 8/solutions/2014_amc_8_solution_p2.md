# 2014 AMC 8 Problem 2

## Problem

Paul owes Paula $35$ cents and has a pocket full of $5$ -cent coins, $10$ -cent coins, and $25$ -cent coins that he can use to pay her. What is the difference between the largest and the smallest number of coins he can use to pay her?

$\textbf{(A) }1\qquad\textbf{(B) }2\qquad\textbf{(C) }3\qquad\textbf{(D) }4\qquad \textbf{(E) }5$

## Solution
The fewest amount of coins that can be used is $2$ (a quarter and a dime). The greatest amount is $7$ , if he only uses nickels. Therefore we have $7-2=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~5}$ .
