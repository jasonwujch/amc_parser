## Problem

There are four more girls than boys in Ms. Raub's class of $28$ students. What is the ratio of number of girls to the number of boys in her class?

$\textbf{(A) }3 : 4\qquad\textbf{(B) }4 : 3\qquad\textbf{(C) }3 : 2\qquad\textbf{(D) }7 : 4\qquad \textbf{(E) }2 : 1$

## Solution 1
Let $g$ being the number of girls in the class. The number of boys in the class is equal to $g-4$ . Since the total number of students is equal to $28$ , we get $g+g-4=28$ . Solving this equation, we get $g=16$ . There are $16-4=12$ boys in our class, and our answer is $16:12=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~4:3}$ .

## Solution 2
To make the amount of boys and girls equal, 28 - 4 = 24. 24/2 = 12. The girls would need to be 12 + the 4 that we subtracted = 16. The boys would be 12. The ratio of girls to boys would be 16 : 12, but simplified would be 4 : 3. Thus, the answer is 4 : 3.

## Solution 3
We should be able to divide 28 by the sum of the ratios. If we do guess and check, the only two that complete these conditions is 3:4 and 4:3 since they add up to 7. But, the number of girls has to be more than the boys, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~4:3}$ .
