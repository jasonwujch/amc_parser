# 2008 AMC 8 Problem 13

## Problem

Mr. Harman needs to know the combined weight in pounds of three boxes he wants to mail. However, the only available scale is not accurate for weights less than $100$ pounds or more than $150$ pounds. So the boxes are weighed in pairs in every possible way. The results are $122$ , $125$ and $127$ pounds. What is the combined weight in pounds of the three boxes?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 160\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 170\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 187\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 195\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 354$

## Solution 1
Each box is weighed twice during this, so the combined weight of the three boxes is half the weight of these separate measures:
\[\frac{122+125+127}{2} = \frac{374}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 187}.\]

## Solution 2
Using variables $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ to denote the boxes, with $a \le b \le c$ . It is obvious that $a+b=122$ and $a+c=125$ , since these are the two smallest pairs. Subtracting the former equation from the latter results in $c-b=3$ . Additionally, $c+b=127$ . Solving for $c$ and $b$ gives $c=65$ and $b=62$ , so we can thus find $a=60$ . Solving $60+62+65=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\ 187}$
