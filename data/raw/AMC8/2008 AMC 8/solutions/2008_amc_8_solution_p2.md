# 2008 AMC 8 Problem 2

## Problem

The ten-letter code $\text{BEST OF LUCK}$ represents the ten digits $0-9$ , in order. What 4-digit number is represented by the code word $\text{CLUE}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 8671 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 8672 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 9781 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 9782 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 9872$

## Solution
We can derive that $C=8$ , $L=6$ , $U=7$ , and $E=1$ . Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 8671}$ ~edited by Owencheng

## Solution 2
We can easily see that $C=8$ , which makes only $(A)$ $8761$ and $(B)$ $8762$ possible. Since the only difference between answer choices $A$ and $B$ is the last digit and that the last digit in the code word "CLUE" is $E$ , we can just find that $E=1$ and that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 8671}$ . ~solution by SuperVince1
