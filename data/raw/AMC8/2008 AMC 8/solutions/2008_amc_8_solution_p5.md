# 2008 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Barney Schwinn notices that the odometer on his bicycle reads $1441$ , a palindrome, because it reads the same forward and backward. After riding $4$ more hours that day and $6$ the next, he notices that the odometer shows another palindrome, $1661$ . What was his average speed in miles per hour?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 16\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 18\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 20\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 22$

## Solution
Barney travels $1661-1441=220$ miles in $4+6=10$ hours for an average of $220/10=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 22}$ miles per hour.
