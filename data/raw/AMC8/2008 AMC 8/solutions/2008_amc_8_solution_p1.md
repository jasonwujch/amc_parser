# 2008 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Susan had 50 dollars to spend at the carnival. She spent 12 dollars on food and twice as much on rides. How many dollars did she have left to spend?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 12 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 14 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 26 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 38 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 50$

## Solution
If Susan spent 12 dollars, then twice that much on rides, then she spent $12+12 \times 2=36$ dollars in total. We subtract $36$ from $50$ to get $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 14}$
