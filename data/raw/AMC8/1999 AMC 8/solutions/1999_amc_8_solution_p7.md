# 1999 AMC 8 Problem 7

## Problem

The third exit on a highway is located at milepost 40 and the tenth exit is at milepost 160. There is a service center on the highway located three-fourths of the way from the third exit to the tenth exit. At what milepost would you expect to find this service center?

$\text{(A)}\ 90 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 100 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 110 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 120 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 130$

## Solution
There are $160-40=120$ miles between the third and tenth exits, so the service center is at milepost $40+(3/4)(120) = 40+90=\boxed{\text{(E)}\ 130}$ .
