## Problem

A rectangular garden 60 feet long and 20 feet wide is enclosed by a fence. To make the garden larger, while using the same fence, its shape is changed to a square. By how many square feet does this enlarge the garden?

$\text{(A)}\ 100 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 200 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 300 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 400 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 500$

## Solution
We need the same perimeter as a $60$ by $20$ rectangle, but the greatest area we can get. right now the perimeter is $160$ . To get the greatest area while keeping a perimeter of $160$ , the sides should all be $40$ . that means an area of $1600$ . Right now, the area is $20 \times 60$ which is $1200$ . $1600-1200=400$ which is $\boxed{D}$ .
