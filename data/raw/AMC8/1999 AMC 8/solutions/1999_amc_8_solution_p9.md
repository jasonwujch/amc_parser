# 1999 AMC 8 Problem 9

## Problem

Three flower beds overlap as shown. Bed A has 500 plants, bed B has 450 plants, and bed C has 350 plants. Beds A and B share 50 plants, while beds A and C share 100. The total number of plants is

[asy] draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,1)--(0,1)--cycle); draw(circle((.3,-.1),.7)); draw(circle((2.8,-.2),.8)); label("A",(1.3,.5),N); label("B",(3.1,-.2),S); label("C",(.6,-.2),S); [/asy]

$\text{(A)}\ 850 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 1000 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 1150 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 1300 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 1450$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Plants shared by two beds have been counted twice, so the total is $500 + 450 + 350 - 50 - 100 = \boxed{\text{(C)}\ 1150}$ .

## Solution 2
Bed A has $350$ plants it doesn't share with B or C. Bed B has $400$ plants it doesn't share with A or C. And C has $250$ it doesn't share with A or B. The total is $350 + 400 + 250 + 50 + 100 = \boxed{\text{(C)}\ 1150}$ plants.
