# 1999 AMC 8 Problem 13

## Problem

The average age of the 40 members of a computer science camp is 17 years. There are 20 girls, 15 boys, and 5 adults. If the average age of the girls is 15 and the average age of the boys is 16, what is the average age of the adults?

$\text{(A)}\ 26 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 27 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 28 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 29 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 30$

## Solution
First, find the total amount of the girl's ages and add it to the total amount of the boy's ages. It equals $(20)(15)+(15)(16)=540$ . The total amount of everyone's ages can be found from the average age, $17\cdot40=680$ . Then you do $680-540=140$ to find the sum of the adult's ages. The average age of an adult is divided among the five of them, $140\div5=\boxed{\text{(C)}\ 28}$ .
