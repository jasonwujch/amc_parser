# 1999 AMC 8 Problem 19

## Problem

At Central Middle School, the 108 students who take the AMC 8 meet in the evening to talk about food and eat an average of two cookies apiece. Hansel and Gretel are baking Bonnie's Best Bar Cookies this year. Their recipe, which makes a pan of 15 cookies, lists these items: $1\frac{1}{2}$ cups flour, $2$ eggs, $3$ tablespoons butter, $\frac{3}{4}$ cups sugar, and $1$ package of chocolate drops. They will make full recipes, not partial recipes.

Hansel and Gretel must make enough pans of cookies to supply 216 cookies. There are 8 tablespoons in a stick of butter. How many sticks of butter will be needed? (Some butter may be leftover, of course.)

$\text{(A)}\ 5 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 6 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 7 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 8 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 9$

## Solution
For $216$ cookies, you need to make $\frac{216}{15} = 14.4$ pans. Since fractional pans are forbidden, round up to make $\lceil \frac{216}{15} \rceil = 15$ pans.
There are $3$ tablespoons of butter per pan, meaning $3 \cdot 15 = 45$ tablespoons of butter are required for $15$ pans.
Each stick of butter has $8$ tablespoons, so we need $\frac{45}{8} = 5.625$ sticks of butter. However, we must round up again because partial sticks of butter are forbidden! Thus, we need $\lceil \frac{45}{8} \rceil = 6$ sticks of butter, and the answer is $\boxed{B}$ .
