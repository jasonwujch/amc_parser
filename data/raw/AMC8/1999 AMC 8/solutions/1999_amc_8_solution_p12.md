## Problem

The ratio of the number of games won to the number of games lost (no ties) by the Middle School Middies is $11/4$ . To the nearest whole percent, what percent of its games did the team lose?

$\text{(A)}\ 24\% \qquad \text{(B)}\ 27\% \qquad \text{(C)}\ 36\% \qquad \text{(D)}\ 45\% \qquad \text{(E)}\ 73\%$

## Solution
The ratio means that for every $11$ games won, $4$ are lost, so the team has won $11x$ games, lost $4x$ games, and played $15x$ games for some positive integer $x$ . The percentage of games lost is just $\dfrac{4x}{15x}\times100=\dfrac{4}{15}\times 100=26.\overline{6}\%\approx\boxed{\text{(B)}\ 27\%}$

## Alternate Solution
The Won/Lost ratio is 11/4 so, for some number $N$ , the team won $11N$ games and lost $4N$ games. Thus, the team played $15N$ games and the fraction of games lost is $\dfrac{4N}{15N}=\dfrac{4}{15}\approx 0.27=\boxed{27\%}.$ -Clara Garza
