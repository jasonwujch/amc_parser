# 2018 AMC 8 Problem 12

## Problem

The clock in Sri's car, which is not accurate, gains time at a constant rate. One day as he begins shopping, he notes that his car clock and his watch (which is accurate) both say 12:00 noon. When he is done shopping, his watch says 12:30 and his car clock says 12:35. Later that day, Sri loses his watch. He looks at his car clock and it says 7:00. What is the actual time?

$\textbf{ (A) }5:50\qquad\textbf{(B) }6:00\qquad\textbf{(C) }6:30\qquad\textbf{(D) }6:55\qquad \textbf{(E) }8:10$

## Solution 1
We see that every $35$ minutes the clock passes, the watch passes $30$ minutes. That means that the clock is $\frac{7}{6}$ as fast the watch, so we can set up proportions. $\dfrac{\text{car clock}}{\text{watch}}=\dfrac{7}{6}=\dfrac{7 \text{ hours}}{x \text{ hours}}$ . Cross-multiplying we get $x=6$ . Now, this is obviously redundant, because we could just eyeball it to see that the watch would have passed $6$ hours. But this method is better when the numbers are a bit more complex, which makes it both easier and reliable. Either way, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }6:00}$ .

## Solution 2
The ratio of the car clock to the watch clock is a ratio of 35:30 or 7:6 due to the clock being ahead by 5 minutes after 30 minutes has passed. This means that when the car clock passes $7$ hours, the watch has passed $6$ hours, meaning that the time would be $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }6:00}$ .

## Solution 3
From 12:00 pm (noon) to 7:00 pm, the car clock has passed 12 35-minute cycles (12 X 35 = 420) because 7 hours = 420 minutes. So, 12 30-minute cycles (12 X 30 = 360) for the watch time are 360 minutes, which is 6 hours. Therefore, 6 hours added to 12:00 pm (noon) makes the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }6:00}$ .

## Solution 4 (a version of solution 3)
7 hours have passed since 12:00 pm and 7 hours = 420 minutes because there are 60 minutes in an hour. Because every 35 minutes, the clock is ahead by 5 minutes, you need to divide 420 by 35 to find out how many times it happens. 420 divided by 35 is 12. Then you would multiply 12 by 5 because the clock is ahead by 5 minutes. 12 times 5 is 60, so that means that the clock is ahead by 60 minutes. In order to find the watch's time, you must find what was 60 minutes earlier than 7:00 which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }6:00}$ .
