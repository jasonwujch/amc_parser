# 2018 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

An amusement park has a collection of scale models, with a ratio of $1: 20$ , of buildings and other sights from around the country. The height of the United States Capitol is $289$ feet. What is the height in feet of its duplicate to the nearest whole number?

$\textbf{(A) }14\qquad\textbf{(B) }15\qquad\textbf{(C) }16\qquad\textbf{(D) }18\qquad\textbf{(E) }20$

## Solution 1(Good Ol' Ratios)
You can see that since the ratio of real building's heights to the model building's height is $1:20$ . We also know that the U.S Capitol is $289$ feet in real life, so to find the height of the model, we divide by 20. That gives us $14.45$ which rounds to 14. Therefore, to the nearest whole number, the duplicate is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }14}$ .

## Solution 2
We can compute $\frac{289}{20}$ and round our answer to get $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }14}$ . It is basically Solution 1 without the ratio calculation. However, Solution 1 is referring further to the problem.

## Solution 3
We know that $20 \cdot 14 = 280 ,$ and that $20 \cdot 15 = 300 .$ These are the multiples of $20$ around $289 ,$ and the closest one of those is $280.$ Therefore, the answer is $\dfrac {280} {20} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }14} .$
