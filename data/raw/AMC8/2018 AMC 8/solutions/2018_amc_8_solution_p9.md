# 2018 AMC 8 Problem 9

## Problem

Monica is tiling the floor of her 12-foot by 16-foot living room. She plans to place one-foot by one-foot square tiles to form a border along the edges of the room and to fill in the rest of the floor with two-foot by two-foot square tiles. How many tiles will she use?

$\textbf{(A) }48\qquad\textbf{(B) }87\qquad\textbf{(C) }89\qquad\textbf{(D) }96\qquad \textbf{(E) }120$

## Solution 1
She will place $(12\cdot2)+(14\cdot2)=52$ tiles around the border. For the inner part of the room, we have $10\cdot14=140$ square feet. Each tile takes up $4$ square feet, so he will use $\frac{140}{4}=35$ tiles for the inner part of the room. Thus, the answer is $52+35= \boxed{\textbf{(B) }87}$ .

## Solution 2
The area around the border: $(12 \cdot 2) + (14 \cdot 2) = 52$ . The area of tiles around the border: $1 \cdot 1 = 1$ . Therefore, $\frac{52}{1} = 52$ is the number of tiles around the border.
The inner part will have $(12 - 2)(16 - 2) = 140$ . The area of those tiles are $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ . $\frac{140}{4} = 35$ is the amount of tiles for the inner part. So, $52 + 35 = \boxed{87}$ .
