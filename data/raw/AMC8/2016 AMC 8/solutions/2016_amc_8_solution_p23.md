## Problem

Two congruent circles centered at points $A$ and $B$ each pass through the other circle's center. The line containing both $A$ and $B$ is extended to intersect the circles at points $C$ and $D$ . The circles intersect at two points, one of which is $E$ . What is the degree measure of $\angle CED$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }90\qquad\textbf{(B) }105\qquad\textbf{(C) }120\qquad\textbf{(D) }135\qquad \textbf{(E) }150$

## Solution
Observe that $\triangle{EAB}$ is equilateral (all are radii of congruent circles). Therefore, $m\angle{AEB}=m\angle{EAB}=m\angle{EBA} = 60^{\circ}$ . Since $CD$ is a straight line, we conclude that $m\angle{EBD} = 180^{\circ}-60^{\circ}=120^{\circ}$ . Since $BE=BD$ (both are radii of the same circle), $\triangle{BED}$ is isosceles, meaning that $m\angle{BED}=m\angle{BDE}=30^{\circ}$ . Similarly, $m\angle{AEC}=m\angle{ACE}=30^{\circ}$ .
Now, $\angle{CED}=m\angle{AEC}+m\angle{AEB}+m\angle{BED} = 30^{\circ}+60^{\circ}+30^{\circ} = 120^{\circ}$ . Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\ 120}$ .
