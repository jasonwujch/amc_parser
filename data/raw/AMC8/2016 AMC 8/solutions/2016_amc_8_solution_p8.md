# 2016 AMC 8 Problem 8

## Problem

Find the value of the expression \[100-98+96-94+92-90+\cdots+8-6+4-2.\] $\textbf{(A) }20\qquad\textbf{(B) }40\qquad\textbf{(C) }50\qquad\textbf{(D) }80\qquad \textbf{(E) }100$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
We can group each subtracting pair together: \[(100-98)+(96-94)+(92-90)+ \ldots +(8-6)+(4-2).\] After subtracting, we have: \[2+2+2+\ldots+2+2=2(1+1+1+\ldots+1+1).\] There are $50$ even numbers, therefore there are $\dfrac{50}{2}=25$ even pairs. Therefore the sum is $2 \cdot 25=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }50}$

## Solution 2
Since our list does not end with one, we divide every number by 2 and we end up with \[50-49+48-47+ \ldots +4-3+2-1\] We can group each subtracting pair together: \[(50-49)+(48-47)+(46-45)+ \ldots +(4-3)+(2-1).\] There are now $25$ pairs of numbers, and the value of each pair is $1$ . This sum is $25$ . However, we divided by $2$ originally so we will multiply $2*25$ to get the final answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }50}$

## Solution 3
Note: This solution is very similar to Solution 1, but simplified.
The value of the expression increases by 2 after every pair as shown:
Pair 1: [100-98= $2$ ]
Pair 1 + 2: [2+96-94= $4$ ]
Pair 1 + 2 + 3: [4+92-90= $6$ ]
Since there is 25 pairs in the expression, the value will increase by two 25 times. Thus, the sum of the expression is $2 \cdot 25=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }50}$
