## Problem

Jefferson Middle School has the same number of boys and girls. $\frac{3}{4}$ of the girls and $\frac{2}{3}$ of the boys went on a field trip. What fraction of the students on the field trip were girls?

$\textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\frac{9}{17}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{7}{13}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\frac{2}{3}\qquad \textbf{(E) }\frac{14}{15}$

## Solution 1
Let there be $b$ boys and $g$ girls in the school. We see $g=b$ , which means $\frac{3}{4}b+\frac{2}{3}b=\frac{17}{12}b$ kids went on the trip and $\frac{3}{4}b$ kids are girls. So, the answer is $\frac{\frac{3}{4}b}{\frac{17}{12}b}=\frac{9}{17}$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)} \frac{9}{17}}$ .

## Solution 2
Using WLOG (Without loss of generativity), Let there be $12$ boys and $12$ girls in the school. Now we can do $\frac{3}{4}\times{12}$ + $\frac{2}{3}\times{12}$ to get the total number of students going to the field trip to be $17$ . Since we already know the number of girls to be $9$ . We have our answer to be $\frac{9}{17}$ . So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)} \frac{9}{17}}$ .
