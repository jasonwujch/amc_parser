# 2016 AMC 8 Problem 10

## Problem

Suppose that $a * b$ means $3a-b.$ What is the value of $x$ if \[2 * (5 * x)=1\] $\textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{10} \qquad\textbf{(B) }2\qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{10}{3} \qquad\textbf{(D) }10\qquad \textbf{(E) }14$

## Solution 1
Let us plug in $(5 * x)=1$ into $3a-b$ . Thus it would be $3(5)-x$ . Now we have $2*(15-x)=1$ . Plugging $2*(15-x)$ into $3a-b$ , we have $6-15+x=1$ . Solving for $x$ we have \[-9+x=1\] \[x=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} \, 10}\]

## Solution 2
Let us set a variable $y$ equal to $5 * x$ . Solving for y in the equation $3(2)-y=1$ , we see that y is equal to five. By substitution, we see that $5 * x$ = 5. Solving for x in the equation $5(3)-x = 5$ we get \[x=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} \, 10}\]
