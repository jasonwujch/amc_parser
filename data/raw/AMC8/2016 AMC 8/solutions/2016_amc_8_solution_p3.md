# 2016 AMC 8 Problem 3

## Problem

Four students take an exam. Three of their scores are $70, 80,$ and $90$ . If the average of their four scores is $70$ , then what is the remaining score?

$\textbf{(A) }40\qquad\textbf{(B) }50\qquad\textbf{(C) }55\qquad\textbf{(D) }60\qquad \textbf{(E) }70$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
Let $r$ be the remaining student's score. We know that the average, 70, is equal to $\frac{70 + 80 + 90 + r}{4}$ . We can use basic algebra to solve for $r$ : \[\frac{70 + 80 + 90 + r}{4} = 70\] \[\frac{240 + r}{4} = 70\] \[240 + r = 280\] \[r = 40\] giving us the answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 40}$ .

## Solution 2
Since $90$ is $20$ more than $70$ , and $80$ is $10$ more than $70$ , for $70$ to be the average, the other number must be $30$ less than $70$ , or $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 40}$ .
