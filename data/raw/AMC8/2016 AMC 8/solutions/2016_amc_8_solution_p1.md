## Problem

The longest professional tennis match ever played lasted a total of $11$ hours and $5$ minutes. How many minutes was this?

$\textbf{(A) }605\qquad\textbf{(B) }655\qquad\textbf{(C) }665\qquad\textbf{(D) }1005\qquad \textbf{(E) }1105$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
It is best to split 11 hours and 5 minutes into 2 parts, one of 11 hours and another of 5 minutes. We know that there is $60$ minutes in a hour. Therefore, there are $11 \cdot 60 = 660$ minutes in 11 hours. Adding the second part(the 5 minutes) we get $660 + 5 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 665}$ .

## Solution 2
The best method comes when you remember your multiplication tables. Thus trivial, we get our answer of $\boxed{{(C) } 665}$ .

## Solution 3
11 hours 5 min = $(11 \cdot 60) + 5 \text{min} = 665 \text{min}$ , therefore $\boxed{{(C) } }$ .
