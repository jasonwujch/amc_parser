# 2016 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

When Cheenu was a boy, he could run $15$ miles in $3$ hours and $30$ minutes. As an old man, he can now walk $10$ miles in $4$ hours. How many minutes longer does it take for him to walk a mile now compared to when he was a boy?

$\textbf{(A) }6\qquad\textbf{(B) }10\qquad\textbf{(C) }15\qquad\textbf{(D) }18\qquad \textbf{(E) }30$

## Solution 1
When Cheenu was a boy, he could run $15$ miles in $3$ hours and $30$ minutes $= 3\times60 + 30$ minutes $= 210$ minutes, thus running $\frac{210}{15} = 14$ minutes per mile. Now that he is an old man, he can walk $10$ miles in $4$ hours $= 4 \times 60$ minutes $= 240$ minutes, thus walking $\frac{240}{10} = 24$ minutes per mile. Therefore, it takes him $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10}$ minutes longer to walk a mile now compared to when he was a boy.

## Solution 2
From the question, the old man can travel five miles in two hours, so we can set both speeds to $15$ miles. We can see that Cheenu as an old man takes $2$ hours and $30$ minutes for him to travel $15$ miles, which is also $150$ minutes. We can then divide this by fifteen, which gives us $10$ , thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{B) 10}}$
