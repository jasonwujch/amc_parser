# 2016 AMC 8 Problem 11

## Problem

Determine how many two-digit numbers satisfy the following property: when the number is added to the number obtained by reversing its digits, the sum is $132.$

$\textbf{(A) }5\qquad\textbf{(B) }7\qquad\textbf{(C) }9\qquad\textbf{(D) }11\qquad \textbf{(E) }12$

## Solution 1
We can see that the original number can be written as $10a+b$ , where $a$ represents the tens digit and $b$ represents the units digit. When this number is added to the number obtained by reversing its digits, which is $10b+a$ , the sum would be $11a+11b$ . From this, we can construct the equation $11a+11b=132$ , which simplifies to $a+b=12$ . Since there are 7 pairs of such digits $a$ and $b$ , $(3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3)$ , the answer would be $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 7}.$
