## Problem

The smallest positive integer greater than 1 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, 5, and 6 lies between which of the following pairs of numbers?

$\textbf{(A) }2\text{ and }19\qquad\textbf{(B) }20\text{ and }39\qquad\textbf{(C) }40\text{ and }59\qquad\textbf{(D) }60\text{ and }79\qquad\textbf{(E) }80\text{ and }124$

## Solution 1
Since the remainder is the same for all numbers, then we will only need to find the lowest common multiple of the three given numbers, and add the given remainder.The $\operatorname{LCM}(4,5,6)$ is $60$ . Since $60+1=61$ , that is in the range of $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \text{60 and 79}}.$

## Solution 2
Call the number we want to find $n$ . We can say that \[n \equiv 1 \mod 4\] \[n \equiv 1 \mod 5\] \[n \equiv 1 \mod 6.\] We can also say that $n-1$ is divisible by $4,5$ , and $6.$ Therefore, $n-1=lcm(4,5,6)=60$ , so $n=60+1=61$ which is in the range of $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \text{60 and 79}}.$
