# 2017 AMC 8 Problem 21

## Problem

Suppose $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are nonzero real numbers, and $a+b+c=0$ . What are the possible value(s) for $\frac{a}{|a|}+\frac{b}{|b|}+\frac{c}{|c|}+\frac{abc}{|abc|}$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }0\qquad\textbf{(B) }1\text{ and }-1\qquad\textbf{(C) }2\text{ and }-2\qquad\textbf{(D) }0,2,\text{ and }-2\qquad\textbf{(E) }0,1,\text{ and }-1$

## Solution
There are $2$ cases to consider:
Case $1$ : $2$ of $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are positive and the other is negative. Without loss of generality (WLOG), we can assume that $a$ and $b$ are positive and $c$ is negative. In this case, we have that \[\frac{a}{|a|}+\frac{b}{|b|}+\frac{c}{|c|}+\frac{abc}{|abc|}=1+1-1-1=0.\]
Case $2$ : $2$ of $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are negative and the other is positive. WLOG, we can assume that $a$ and $b$ are negative and $c$ is positive. In this case, we have that \[\frac{a}{|a|}+\frac{b}{|b|}+\frac{c}{|c|}+\frac{abc}{|abc|}=-1-1+1+1=0.\]
Note these are the only valid cases, for neither $3$ negatives nor $3$ positives would work as they cannot sum up to $0$ . In both cases, we get that the given expression equals $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0}$ .
