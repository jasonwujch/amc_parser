# 2017 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

When $0.000315$ is multiplied by $7,928,564$ the product is closest to which of the following?

$\textbf{(A) }210\qquad\textbf{(B) }240\qquad\textbf{(C) }2100\qquad\textbf{(D) }2400\qquad\textbf{(E) }24000$

## Solution
We can approximate $7,928,564$ to $8,000,000$ and $0.000315$ to $0.0003.$ Multiplying the two yields $2400.$ Thus, it shows our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 2400}.$
