# 2017 AMC 8 Problem 17

## Problem

Starting with some gold coins and some empty treasure chests, I tried to put $9$ gold coins in each treasure chest, but that left $2$ treasure chests empty. So instead I put $6$ gold coins in each treasure chest, but then I had $3$ gold coins left over. How many gold coins did I have?

$\textbf{(A) }9\qquad\textbf{(B) }27\qquad\textbf{(C) }45\qquad\textbf{(D) }63\qquad\textbf{(E) }81$

## Solution 1 (Using Equations)
We can represent the amount of gold with $g$ and the amount of chests with $c$ . We can use the problem to make the following equations: \[9c-18 = g\] \[6c+3 = g\]
We do this because for 9 chests there are 2 empty and if 9 were in each 9 multiplied by 2 is 18 left.
Therefore, $6c+3 = 9c-18.$ This implies that $c = 7.$ We therefore have $g = 45.$ So, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 45}$ .

## Solution 2 (Using Answer Choices)
With $9$ coins, there are $\frac{9}{9}+2=1+2=3$ chests, by the first condition. These don't fit in with the second condition, so we move onto $27$ coins. By the same first condition, there are $5$ chests( $\frac{27}{9}+2$ ). This also doesn't fit with the second condition. So, onto $45$ coins. The first condition implies that there are $\frac{45}{9}+2=7$ chests, which DOES fit with the second condition, since $6\cdot7+3=42+3=45$ . Thus, the desired value is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 45}$ .
