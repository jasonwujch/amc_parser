# 2017 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Which of the following values is largest?

$\textbf{(A) }2+0+1+7\qquad\textbf{(B) }2 \times 0 +1+7\qquad\textbf{(C) }2+0 \times 1 + 7\qquad\textbf{(D) }2+0+1 \times 7\qquad\textbf{(E) }2 \times 0 \times 1 \times 7$

## Solution 1
We will compute each expression.
A) $2 + 0 + 1 + 7 = 10$
B) $2 \times 0 + 1 + 7 = 8$
C) $2 + 0 \times 1 + 7 = 9$
D) $2 + 0 + 1 \times 7 = 9$
E) $2 \times 0 \times 1 \times 7 = 0$
Ordering these, we get $10, 8, 9, 9, 0$ . Out of these, $10$ is the largest number and option $(A)$ adds up to $10$ . Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 2+0+1+7}$ .

## Solution 2
We immediately see that every one of the choices, except for A and D, has a number multiplied by $0$ . This will only make the expression's value smaller. We are left with A and D, but in D, $1$ is multiplied by $7$ to get $7$ , whereas in answer choice A, we get $8$ out of $7$ and $1$ , instead of $7$ . Therefore, $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 2+0+1+7}$ is your answer.
