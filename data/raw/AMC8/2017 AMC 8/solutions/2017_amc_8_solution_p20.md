# 2017 AMC 8 Problem 20

## Problem

An integer between 1000 and 9999, inclusive, is chosen at random. What is the probability that it is an odd integer whose digits are all distinct? (A) $\dfrac{14}{75}$ (B) $\dfrac{56}{225}$ (C) $\dfrac{107}{400}$ (D) $\dfrac{7}{25}$ (E) $\dfrac{9}{25}$

## Solution
There are $5$ options for the last digit as the integer must be odd. The first digit now has $8$ options left (it can't be $0$ or the same as the last digit). The second digit also has $8$ options left (it can't be the same as the first or last digit). Finally, the third digit has $7$ options (it can't be the same as the three digits that are already chosen).
Since there are $9,000$ total integers, our answer is \[\frac{8 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 5}{9000} = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{56}{225}}.\]
