# 2017 AMC 8 Problem 8

## Problem

Malcolm wants to visit Isabella after school today and knows the street where she lives but doesn't know her house number. She tells him, "My house number has two digits, and exactly three of the following four statements about it are true."

(1) It is prime.

(2) It is even.

(3) It is divisible by 7.

(4) One of its digits is 9.

This information allows Malcolm to determine Isabella's house number. What is its units digit?

$\textbf{(A) }4\qquad\textbf{(B) }6\qquad\textbf{(C) }7\qquad\textbf{(D) }8\qquad\textbf{(E) }9$

## Solution
Notice that (1) cannot be true. Otherwise, the number would have to be prime and be either even or divisible by 7. This only happens if the number is 2 or 7, neither of which are two-digit numbers, so we run into a contradiction. Thus, we must have (2), (3), and (4) be true. By (2), the $2$ -digit number is even, and thus, the digit in the tens place must be $9$ . The only even $2$ -digit number starting with $9$ and divisible by $7$ is $98$ , which has a units digit of $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 8}.$
