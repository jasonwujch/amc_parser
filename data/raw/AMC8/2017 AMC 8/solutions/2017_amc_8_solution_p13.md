## Problem

Peter, Emma, and Kyler played chess with each other. Peter won 4 games and lost 2 games. Emma won 3 games and lost 3 games. If Kyler lost 3 games, how many games did he win?

$\textbf{(A) }0\quad\textbf{(B) }1\qquad\textbf{(C) }2\qquad\textbf{(D) }3\qquad\textbf{(E) }4$

## Solution
Given $n$ games, there must be a total of $n$ wins and $n$ losses. Hence, $4 + 3 + K = 2 + 3 + 3$ where $K$ is Kyler's wins. $K = 1$ , so our final answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1}.$ ~CHECKMATE2021
