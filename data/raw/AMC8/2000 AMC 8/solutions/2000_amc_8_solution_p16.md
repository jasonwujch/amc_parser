# 2000 AMC 8 Problem 16

## Problem

In order for Mateen to walk a kilometer (1000m) in his rectangular backyard, he must walk the length 25 times or walk its perimeter 10 times. What is the area of Mateen's backyard in square meters?

$\text{(A)}\ 40 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 200 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 400 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 500 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 1000$

## Solution
The length $L$ of the rectangle is $\frac{1000}{25}=40$ meters. The perimeter $P$ is $\frac{1000}{10}=100$ meters. Since $P_{rect} = 2L + 2W$ , we plug values in to get:
$100 = 2\cdot 40 + 2W$
$100 = 80 + 2W$
$2W = 20$
$W = 10$ meters
Since $A_{rect} = LW$ , the area is $40\cdot 10=400$ square meters or $\boxed{C}$ .
