# 2000 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Aunt Anna is $42$ years old. Caitlin is $5$ years younger than Brianna, and Brianna is half as old as Aunt Anna. How old is Caitlin?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 15\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 16\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 17\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 21\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 37$

## Solution 1
If Brianna is half as old as Aunt Anna, then Brianna is $\frac{42}{2}$ years old, or $21$ years old.
If Caitlin is $5$ years younger than Brianna, she is $21-5$ years old, or $16$ .
So, the answer is $\boxed{B}$
