# 2000 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Each principal of Lincoln High School serves exactly one $3$ -year term. What is the maximum number of principals this school could have during an $8$ -year period?

$\text{(A)}\ 2 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 3 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 4 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 5 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 8$

## Solution
If the first year of the $8$ -year period was the final year of a principal's term, then in the next six years two more principals would serve, and the last year of the period would be the first year of the fourth principal's term. Therefore, the maximum number of principals who can serve during an $8$ -year period is $4$ , so the answer is $\boxed{C}$ if the terms are divided $1\ |\ 2\ 3\ 4\ |\ 5\ 6\ 7\ |\ 8$
