# 2000 AMC 8 Problem 7

## Problem

What is the minimum possible product of three different numbers of the set $\{-8,-6,-4,0,3,5,7\}$ ?

$\text{(A)}\ -336 \qquad \text{(B)}\ -280 \qquad \text{(C)}\ -210 \qquad \text{(D)}\ -192 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 0$

## Solution
The only way to get a negative product using three numbers is to multiply one negative number and two positives or three negatives. Only two reasonable choices exist: $(-8)\times(-6)\times(-4) = (-8)\times(24) = -192$ and $(-8)\times5\times7 = (-8)\times35 = -280$ . The latter is smaller, so $\boxed{\text{(B)\ -280}}$ .
