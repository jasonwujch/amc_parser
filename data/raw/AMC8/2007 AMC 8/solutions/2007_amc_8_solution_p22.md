## Problem

A lemming sits at a corner of a square with side length $10$ meters. The lemming runs $6.2$ meters along a diagonal toward the opposite corner. It stops, makes a $90^{\circ}$ right turn and runs $2$ more meters. A scientist measures the shortest distance between the lemming and each side of the square. What is the average of these four distances in meters?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 4.5 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 6.2 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 7$

## Solution 1
The shortest segments would be perpendicular to the square. The lemming went $x$ meters horizontally and $y$ meters vertically. No matter how much it went, the lemming would have been $x$ and $y$ meters from the sides and $10-x$ and $10-y$ meters from the remaining two. To find the average, add the lengths of the four segments and divide by four: $\frac {\cancel{x}+10-\cancel{x}+\cancel{y}+10-\cancel{y}}{4} =$ $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 5}$ .

## Solution 2
For any point in the square, the sum of its distance to the left edge and right edge is equal to $10$ , and the sum of its distance to the up edge and down edge is also equal to $10$ . Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 5}$ , and the moving progress is misguide at all.
