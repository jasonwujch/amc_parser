# 2007 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

A haunted house has six windows. In how many ways can Georgie the Ghost enter the house by one window and leave by a different window?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 12 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 15 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 18 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 30 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 36$

## Solution
Georgie can enter the haunted house through any of the six windows. Then, he can leave through any of the remaining five windows.
So, Georgie has a total of $6 \cdot 5$ ways he can enter the house by one window and leave by a different window.
Therefore, we have $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 30}$ ways.
