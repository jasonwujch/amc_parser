# 2007 AMC 8 Problem 6

## Problem

The average cost of a long-distance call in the USA in $1985$ was $41$ cents per minute, and the average cost of a long-distance call in the USA in $2005$ was $7$ cents per minute. Find the approximate percent decrease in the cost per minute of a long- distance call.

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 7 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 17 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 34 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 41 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 80$

## Solution
The percent decrease is (the amount of decrease)/(original amount)
the amount of decrease is $41 - 7 = 34$
so the percent decrease is $\frac{34}{41}$ which is about $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 80\%}$
