# 2007 AMC 8 Problem 21

## Problem

Two cards are dealt from a deck of four red cards labeled $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ and four green cards labeled $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ . A winning pair is two of the same color or two of the same letter. What is the probability of drawing a winning pair?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{2}{7}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{3}{8}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{4}{7}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{5}{8}$

## Solution 2
Notice that, no matter which card you choose, there are exactly $4$ cards that either have the same color or letter as it. Since there are $7$ cards left to choose from, the probability is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\frac47}$ . -theepiccarrot7

## Solution 3
We can use casework to solve this.
Case $1$ : Same letter
After choosing any letter, there are seven cards left, and only one of them will produce a winning pair. Therefore, the probability is $\frac17$ .
Case $2$ : Same color
After choosing any letter, there are seven cards left. Three of them will make a winning pair, so the probability is $\frac37$ .
Now that we have the probability for both cases, we can add them: $\frac17+\frac37=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} \frac47}$ .
