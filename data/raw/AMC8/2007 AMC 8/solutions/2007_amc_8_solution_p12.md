## Problem

A unit hexagram is composed of a regular hexagon of side length $1$ and its $6$ equilateral triangular extensions, as shown in the diagram. What is the ratio of the area of the extensions to the area of the original hexagon?

[asy] defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); draw(polygon(3)); pair D=origin+1*dir(270), E=origin+1*dir(150), F=1*dir(30); draw(D--E--F--cycle); [/asy]

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 1:1 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 6:5 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 3:2 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 2:1 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 3:1$

## Solution
The six equilateral triangular extensions fit perfectly into the hexagon meaning the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1:1}$

## Solution 2
Split the hexagon into six small equilateral triangles. You will see that the six outer triangles can be folded to the hexagon, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1:1}.$
