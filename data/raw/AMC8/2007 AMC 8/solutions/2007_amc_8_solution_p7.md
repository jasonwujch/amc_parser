## Problem

The average age of $5$ people in a room is $30$ years. An $18$ -year-old person leaves the room. What is the average age of the four remaining people?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 25 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 26 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 29 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 33 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 36$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ be the average of the remaining $4$ people.
The equation we get is $\frac{4x + 18}{5} = 30$
Simplify,
$4x + 18 = 150$
$4x = 132$
$x = 33$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 33}$

## Solution 2
Since an $18$ year old left from a group of people averaging $30$ , The remaining people must total $30 - 18 = 12$ years older than $30$ . Therefore, the average is $\dfrac{12}{4} = 3$ years over $30$ . Giving us $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 33}$

## Solution 3
The total ages would be $30*5=150$ . Then, if one $18$ year old leaves, we subtract $18$ from $150$ and get $132$ . Then, we divide $132$ by $4$ to get the new average, $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 33}$
