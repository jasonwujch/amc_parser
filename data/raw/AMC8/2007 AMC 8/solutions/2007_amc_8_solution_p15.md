# 2007 AMC 8 Problem 15

## Problem

Let $a, b$ and $c$ be numbers with $0 < a < b < c$ . Which of the following is impossible?

$\mathrm{(A)} \ a + c < b \qquad \mathrm{(B)} \ a \cdot b < c \qquad \mathrm{(C)} \ a + b < c \qquad \mathrm{(D)} \ a \cdot c < b \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\frac{b}{c} = a$

## Solution
According to the given rules, every number needs to be positive. Since $c$ is always greater than $b$ , adding a positive number ( $a$ ) to $c$ will always make it greater than $b$ .
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ a+c<b}$

## Solution 2
We can test numbers into the inequality we’re given. The simplest is $0<1<2<3$ . We can see that $3+1>2$ , so $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }a+c<b}$ is correct.
