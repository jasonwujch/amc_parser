## Problem

A mixture of $30$ liters of paint is $25\%$ red tint, $30\%$ yellow tint and $45\%$ water. Five liters of yellow tint are added to the original mixture. What is the percent of yellow tint in the new mixture?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 25 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 35 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 40 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 45 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 50$

## Solution
Since $30\%$ of the original $30$ liters of paint was yellow, and $5$ liters of yellow paint were added to make the new mixture, there are $9+5=14$ liters of yellow tint in the new mixture. Since only $5$ liters of paint were added to the original $30$ , there are a total of $35$ liters of paint in the new mixture. This gives $40\%$ of yellow tint in the new mixture, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) 40}}$ .
