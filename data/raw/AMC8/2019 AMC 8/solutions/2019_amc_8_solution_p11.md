## Problem

The eighth grade class at Lincoln Middle School has $93$ students. Each student takes a math class or a foreign language class or both. There are $70$ eighth graders taking a math class, and there are $54$ eighth graders taking a foreign language class. How many eighth graders take only a math class and not a foreign language class?

$\textbf{(A) }16\qquad\textbf{(B) }53\qquad\textbf{(C) }31\qquad\textbf{(D) }39\qquad\textbf{(E) }70$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ be the number of students taking both a math and a foreign language class.
By P-I-E, we get $70 + 54 - x$ = $93$ .
Solving gives us $x = 31$ .
But we want the number of students taking only a math class,
which is $70 - 31 = 39$ .
$\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 39}$

## Solution 2
We have $70 + 54 = 124$ people taking classes. However, we over-counted the number of people who take both classes. If we subtract the original amount of people who take classes we get that $31$ people took the two classes. To find the amount of people who took only math class, we subtract the people who didn't take only one math class, so we get $70 - 31 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} \, 39}$ .

## Solution 3
[asy] draw(circle((-0.5,0),1)); draw(circle((0.5,0),1)); label("$\huge{x}$", (0, 0)); label("$70-x$", (-1, 0)); label("$54-x$", (1, 0)); [/asy]
We know that the sum of all three areas is $93$ So, we have: \[93 = 70-x+x+54-x\] \[93 = 70+54-x\] \[93 = 124 - x\] \[-31=-x\] \[x=31\]
We are looking for the number of students in only math. This is $70-x$ . Substituting $x$ with $31$ , our answer is $\boxed{39}$ .

## Solution 4
We are looking for students in math only, which is the complement (exactly the rest of the students) compared to those taking a language class. Since $54$ students take a language (with or without math), we subtract that from the total number of students. Since $93-54= 39,$ our answer is $\boxed{(D) 39}.$ (It's not necessary to know that $70$ students take math.) ~hailstone
