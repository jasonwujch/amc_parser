# 2019 AMC 8 Problem 20

## Problem

How many different real numbers $x$ satisfy the equation \[(x^{2}-5)^{2}=16?\]

$\textbf{(A) }0\qquad\textbf{(B) }1\qquad\textbf{(C) }2\qquad\textbf{(D) }4\qquad\textbf{(E) }8$

## Solution 1
We have that $(x^2-5)^2 = 16$ if and only if $x^2-5 = \pm 4$ . If $x^2-5 = 4$ , then $x^2 = 9 \implies x = \pm 3$ , giving 2 solutions. If $x^2-5 = -4$ , then $x^2 = 1 \implies x = \pm 1$ , giving 2 more solutions. All four of these solutions work, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$ . Further, the equation is a quartic in $x$ , so by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra , there can be at most four real solutions.

## Solution 2
We can expand $(x^2-5)^2$ to get $x^4-10x^2+25$ , so now our equation is $x^4-10x^2+25=16$ . Subtracting $16$ from both sides gives us $x^4-10x^2+9=0$ . Now, we can factor the left-hand side to get $(x^2-9)(x^2-1)=0$ . If $x^2-9$ and/or $x^2-1$ equals $0$ , then the entire left side will equal $0$ . Since the solutions can be both positive and negative, we have $4$ solutions: $-3,3,-1,1$ (we can find these solutions by setting $x^2-9$ and $x^2-1$ equal to $0$ and solving for $x$ ). So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$ .

## Solution 3
Subtract 16 from both sides and factor using difference of squares:
\[(x^2 - 5)^2 = 16\] \[(x^2 - 5)^2 - 16 =0\] \[(x^2 - 5)^2 - 4^2 = 0\] \[[(x^2 - 5)-4][(x^2 - 5) + 4] = 0\] \[(x^2 - 9)(x^2 - 1) =0\] \[(x+3)(x-3)(x+1)(x-1) = 0\]
Quite obviously, this equation has $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$ solutions.
