# 2019 AMC 8 Problem 10

## Problem

The diagram shows the number of students at soccer practice each weekday during last week. After computing the mean and median values, Coach discovers that there were actually $21$ participants on Wednesday. Which of the following statements describes the change in the mean and median after the correction is made?

$\textbf{(A) }$ The mean increases by $1$ and the median does not change.

$\textbf{(B) }$ The mean increases by $1$ and the median increases by $1$ .

$\textbf{(C) }$ The mean increases by $1$ and the median increases by $5$ .

$\textbf{(D) }$ The mean increases by $5$ and the median increases by $1$ .

$\textbf{(E) }$ The mean increases by $5$ and the median increases by $5$ .

## Solution
On Monday, $20$ people come. On Tuesday, $26$ people come. On Wednesday, $16$ people come. On Thursday, $22$ people come. Finally, on Friday, $16$ people come. $20+26+16+22+16=100$ , so the mean is $20$ . The median is $(16, 16, 20, 22, 26)$ $20$ . The coach figures out that actually $21$ people come on Wednesday. The new mean is $21$ , while the new median is $(16, 20, 21, 22, 26)$ $21$ . Also, the median increases by $1$ because now the median is $21$ instead of $20$ . The median and mean both change, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$ .
Another way to compute the change in mean is to notice that the sum increased by $5$ with the correction. So, the average increased by $5/5 = 1$ .
