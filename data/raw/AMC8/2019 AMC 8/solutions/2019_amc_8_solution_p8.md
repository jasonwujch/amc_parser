## Problem

Gilda has a bag of marbles. She gives $20\%$ of them to her friend Pedro. Then Gilda gives $10\%$ of what is left to another friend, Ebony. Finally, Gilda gives $25\%$ of what is now left in the bag to her brother Jimmy. What percentage of her original bag of marbles does Gilda have left for herself?

$\textbf{(A) }20\qquad\textbf{(B) }33\frac{1}{3}\qquad\textbf{(C) }38\qquad\textbf{(D) }45\qquad\textbf{(E) }54$

## Solution 1
After Gilda gives $20$ % of the marbles to Pedro, she has $80$ % of the marbles left. If she then gives $10$ % of what's left to Ebony, she has $(0.8*0.9)$ = $72$ % of what she had at the beginning. Finally, she gives $25$ % of what's left to her brother, so she has $(0.75*0.72)$ $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 54}$ of what she had in the beginning left.

## Solution 2
WOLG, suppose that Gilda has $100$ marbles.
Then, she gives Pedro 20% of $100$ , which equals $20$ , leaving her with $80$ marbles.
Out of $80$ marbles, she gives 10% of $80$ , which is 8 to Ebony.
Thus, she remains with $72$ marbles.
Then, she gives 25% of $72$ , which equals $18$ to Jimmy, finally leaving her with $54$ .
And, $\frac{54}{100}$ =54%= $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 54}$ .

## Solution 3
(Only if you have lots of time do it this way) Since she gave away 20% and 10% of what is left and then another 25% of what is actually left, we can do 20+10+25 or 55%. But it is actually going to be a bit more than 55% because 10% of what is left is not 10% of the total amount. So, the only option that is greater than 100% - 55% is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 54}$ .
