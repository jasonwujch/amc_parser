## Problem

Alex and Felicia each have cats as pets. Alex buys cat food in cylindrical cans that are $6$ cm in diameter and $12$ cm high. Felicia buys cat food in cylindrical cans that are $12$ cm in diameter and $6$ cm high. What is the ratio of the volume of one of Alex's cans to the volume of one of Felicia's cans?

$\textbf{(A) }1:4\qquad\textbf{(B) }1:2\qquad\textbf{(C) }1:1\qquad\textbf{(D) }2:1\qquad\textbf{(E) }4:1$

## Solution 1
Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we get Alex, $108\pi$ , and Felicia, $216\pi$ . We can quickly notice that $\pi$ cancels out on both sides and that Alex's volume is $1/2$ of Felicia's leaving $1/2 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1:2}$ as the answer.

## Solution 2
Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we get that the volume of Alex's can is $3^2\cdot12\cdot\pi$ , and that the volume of Felicia's can is $6^2\cdot6\cdot\pi$ . Now, we divide the volume of Alex's can by the volume of Felicia's can, so we get $\frac{1}{2}$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1:2}$ .

## Solution 3
The ratio of the numbers is $1/2$ . Looking closely at the formula $r^2 * h * \pi$ , we see that the $r * h * \pi$ will cancel, meaning that the ratio of them will be $\frac{1(2)}{2(2)}$ = $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1:2}$ .

## Solution 4
The second can is $\cdot 2$ size in each of 2 dimensions, and $\cdot 1/2$ size in 1 dimension. $2^2/2 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1:2}$ .

## Solution 5
Without calculating much, you can do ( $\pi ra^2) \cdot ha$ <-- which is Alex's volume, with ra being Alex's radius $(1/2 \cdot$ diameter), and $ha$ being her cylinders height $(\pi rf^2) \cdot hf <--$ which is Felicia's volume, with $rf$ being Felicia's radius, and $hf$ being her cylinders height. Since we need the ratio between Alexa's and Felicias, we can do $(\pi ra^2)\cdot ha/(\pi rf^2)\cdot hf$ The $\pi$ cancel out, then substitute back in the numbers, which gives you:
$(3^2 \cdot 12)/(6^2 \cdot 6) = (9 \cdot 12)/(36 \cdot 6) = 18/36 = 1/2 = 1:2$
