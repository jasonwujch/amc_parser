## Problem

The faces of each of two fair dice are numbered $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , $7$ , and $8$ . When the two dice are tossed, what is the probability that their sum will be an even number?

$\textbf{(A) }\frac{4}{9}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{5}{9}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\frac{3}{5}\qquad\textbf{(E) }\frac{2}{3}$

## Solution 1
We have $2$ dice with $2$ evens and $4$ odds on each die. For the sum to be even, the 2 rolls must be $2$ odds or $2$ evens.
Ways to roll $2$ odds (Case $1$ ): The total number of ways to obtain $2$ odds on 2 rolls is $4*4=16$ , as there are $4$ possible odds on the first roll and $4$ possible odds on the second roll.
Ways to roll $2$ evens (Case $2$ ): Similarly, we have $2*2=4$ ways to obtain 2 evens. Probability is $\frac{20}{36}=\frac{5}{9}$ , or $\framebox{C}$ .

## Solution 2 (Complementary Counting)
We count the ways to get an odd. If the sum is odd, then we must have an even and an odd. The probability of an even is $\frac{1}{3}$ , and the probability of an odd is $\frac{2}{3}$ . We have to multiply by $2$ because the even and odd can be in any order. This gets us $\frac{4}{9}$ , so the answer is $1 - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{5}{9} = \boxed{(\textbf{C})}$ .

## Solution 3
To get an even, you must get either 2 odds or 2 evens. The probability of getting 2 odds is $\frac{4}{6} \times \frac{4}{6}$ . The probability of getting 2 evens is $\frac{2}{6} \times \frac{2}{6}$ . If you add them together, you get $\frac{16}{36} + \frac{4}{36}$ = $\boxed{(\textbf{C}) \frac{5}{9}}$ .
