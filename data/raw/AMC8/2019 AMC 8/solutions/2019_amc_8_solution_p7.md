# 2019 AMC 8 Problem 7

## Problem

Shauna takes five tests, each worth a maximum of $100$ points. Her scores on the first three tests are $76$ , $94$ , and $87$ . In order to average $81$ for all five tests, what is the lowest score she could earn on one of the other two tests?

$\textbf{(A) }48\qquad\textbf{(B) }52\qquad\textbf{(C) }66\qquad\textbf{(D) }70\qquad\textbf{(E) }74$

## Solution 1
We should notice that we can turn the information we are given into a linear equation and just solve for our set variables. I'll use the variables $x$ and $y$ for the scores on the last two tests. \[\frac{76+94+87+x+y}{5} = 81,\] \[\frac{257+x+y}{5} = 81.\] We can now cross multiply to get rid of the denominator. \[257+x+y = 405,\] \[x+y = 148.\] Now that we have this equation, we will assign $y$ as the lowest score of the two other tests, and so: \[x = 100,\] \[y=48.\] Now we know that the lowest score on the two other tests is $\boxed{48}$ .

## Solution 2
Right now, she scored $76, 94,$ and $87$ points, for a total of $257$ points. She wants her average to be $81$ for her $5$ tests, so she needs to score $405$ points in total. This means she needs to score a total of $405-257= 148$ points in her next $2$ tests. Since the maximum score she can get on one of her $2$ tests is $100$ , the least possible score she can get is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 48}$ .
Note: You can verify that $\boxed{48}$ is the right answer because it is the lowest answer out of the 5. Since it is possible to get 48, we are guaranteed that that is the right answer.

## Solution 3
We can compare each of the scores with the average of $81$ : $76$ $\rightarrow$ $-5$ , $94$ $\rightarrow$ $+13$ , $87$ $\rightarrow$ $+6$ , $100$ $\rightarrow$ $+19$ ;
So the last one has to be $-33$ (since all the differences have to sum to $0$ ), which corresponds to $81-33 = \boxed{48}$ .

## Solution 4
We know that she scored $76, 94,$ and $87$ points on her first $3$ tests for a total of $257$ points and that she wants her average to be $81$ for her $5$ total tests. Therefore, she needs to score a total of $405$ points. In addition, one of the final $2$ tests needs to be the maximum of $100$ points, to make the final test score—the one that we are looking for—the lowest score possible for her to earn. We can now see here that the sum of $76+94+100$ has a units digit of $0$ and that the final test score must have a units digit ending with a $5$ . Now, $87$ needs to be added to a number that makes the sum divisible by $5$ . Among the answer choices of $48, 52, 66, 70,$ and $74$ , only $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 48}$ has a units digit that works. ( $48+87=135$ , giving us a units digit of $5$ .)
