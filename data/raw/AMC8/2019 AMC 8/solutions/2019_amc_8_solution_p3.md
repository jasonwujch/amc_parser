# 2019 AMC 8 Problem 3

## Problem

Which of the following is the correct order of the fractions $\frac{15}{11},\frac{19}{15},$ and $\frac{17}{13},$ from least to greatest?

$\textbf{(A) }\frac{15}{11}< \frac{17}{13}< \frac{19}{15} \qquad\textbf{(B) }\frac{15}{11}< \frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13} \qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{17}{13}<\frac{19}{15}<\frac{15}{11} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \frac{19}{15}<\frac{15}{11}<\frac{17}{13} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13}<\frac{15}{11}$

## Solution 1 (Bashing/Butterfly Method)
We take a common denominator: \[\frac{15}{11},\frac{19}{15}, \frac{17}{13} = \frac{15\cdot 15 \cdot 13}{11\cdot 15 \cdot 13},\frac{19 \cdot 11 \cdot 13}{15\cdot 11 \cdot 13}, \frac{17 \cdot 11 \cdot 15}{13\cdot 11 \cdot 15} = \frac{2925}{2145},\frac{2717}{2145},\frac{2805}{2145}.\]
Since $2717<2805<2925$ it follows that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13}<\frac{15}{11}}$ .
Another approach to this problem is using the properties of one fraction being greater than another, also known as the butterfly method . That is, if $\frac{a}{b}>\frac{c}{d}$ , then it must be true that $a * d$ is greater than $b * c$ . Using this approach, we can check for at least two distinct pairs of fractions and find out the greater one of those two, logically giving us the expected answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13}<\frac{15}{11}}$ .

## Solution 2
When $\frac{x}{y}>1$ and $z>0$ , $\frac{x+z}{y+z}<\frac{x}{y}$ . Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13}<\frac{15}{11}}$ . ~ ryjs
This is also similar to Problem 20 on the 2012 AMC 8.

## Solution 3 (probably won't use this solution)
We use our insane mental calculator to find out that $\frac{15}{11} \approx 1.36$ , $\frac{19}{15} \approx 1.27$ , and $\frac{17}{13} \approx 1.31$ . Thus, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13}<\frac{15}{11}}$ .

## Solution 4
Suppose each fraction is expressed with denominator $2145$ : $\frac{2925}{2145}, \frac{2717}{2145}, \frac{2805}{2145}$ . Clearly $2717<2805<2925$ so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}}$ .

## Solution 5 -SweetMango77
We notice that each of these fraction's numerator $-$ denominator $=4$ . If we take each of the fractions, and subtract $1$ from each, we get $\frac{4}{11}$ , $\frac{4}{15}$ , and $\frac{4}{13}$ . These are easy to order because the numerators are the same, we get $\frac{4}{15}<\frac{4}{13}<\frac{4}{11}$ . Because it is a subtraction by a constant, in order to order them, we keep the inequality signs to get $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\;\frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13}<\frac{15}{11}}$ .

## Solution 6
Adding on to Solution 5, we can turn each of the fractions $\frac{15}{11}$ , $\frac{17}{13}$ , and $\frac{19}{15}$ into $1$ $\frac{4}{11}$ , $1$ $\frac{4}{13}$ , and $1$ $\frac{4}{15}$ , respectively. We now subtract $1$ from each to get $\frac{4}{11}$ , $\frac{4}{15}$ , and $\frac{4}{13}$ . Since their numerators are all 4, this is easy because we know that $\frac{1}{15}<\frac{1}{13}<\frac{1}{11}$ and therefore $\frac{4}{15}<\frac{4}{13}<\frac{4}{11}$ . Reverting them back to their original fractions, we can now see that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\;\frac{19}{15}<\frac{17}{13}<\frac{15}{11}}$ .

### Butterfly Method
The butterfly method is a method when you multiply the denominator of the second fraction and multiply it by the numerator from the first fraction.
