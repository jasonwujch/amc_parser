# 2001 AMC 8 Problem 22

## Problem

On a twenty-question test, each correct answer is worth 5 points, each unanswered question is worth 1 point and each incorrect answer is worth 0 points. Which of the following scores is NOT possible?

$\text{(A)}\ 90 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 91 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 92 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 95 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 97$

## Solution
The highest possible score is if you get every answer right, to get $5(20)=100$ . The second highest possible score is if you get $19$ questions right and leave the remaining one blank, to get a $5(19)+1(1)=96$ . Therefore, no score between $96$ and $100$ , exclusive, is possible, so $97$ is not possible, $\boxed{\text{E}}$ .

## Solution 2
We can equivalently construct the following rules: You have 100 point at first, but if you give the wrong answer, you will lose 5 points, if you don't answer a question you will lose 4 points. Obviously, you can lose 10 points, 9 points, 8 points, 5 points or 4 points, but you cannot lose 3 points. The answer is $\boxed{\text{E}}$ .
