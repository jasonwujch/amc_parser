# 2001 AMC 8 Problem 6

## Problem

Six trees are equally spaced along one side of a straight road. The distance from the first tree to the fourth is 60 feet. What is the distance in feet between the first and last trees?

$\text{(A)}\ 90 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 100 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 105 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 120 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 140$

## Solution
There are $3$ spaces between the 1st and 4th trees, so each of these spaces has $\frac{60}{3}=20$ feet. Between the first and last trees there are $5$ spaces, so the distance between them is $20\times5=100$ feet, $\boxed{\text{B}}$ .
