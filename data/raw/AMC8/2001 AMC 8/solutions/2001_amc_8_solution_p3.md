# 2001 AMC 8 Problem 3

## Problem

Granny Smith has $63. Elberta has $2 more than Anjou and Anjou has one-third as much as Granny Smith. How many dollars does Elberta have?

$\text{(A)}\ 17 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 18 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 19 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 21 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 23$

## Solution
Since Anjou has $\frac{1}{3}$ the amount of money as Granny Smith and Granny Smith has $ $63$ , Anjou has $\frac{1}{3}\times63=21$ dollars. Elberta has $ $2$ more than this, so she has $ $23$ , or $\boxed{\text{E}}$ .
