# 2001 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Casey's shop class is making a golf trophy. He has to paint 300 dimples on a golf ball. If it takes him 2 seconds to paint one dimple, how many minutes will it take for him to finish

$\mathrm{(A) \ 4 } \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ 6 } \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ 8 } \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ 10 } \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ 12 }$

## Solution
It will take him $300\cdot2=600$ seconds to paint all the dimples.
This is equivalent to $\frac{600}{60}=10$ minutes $\Rightarrow \boxed{D}$ .
