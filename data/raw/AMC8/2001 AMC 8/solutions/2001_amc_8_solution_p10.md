# 2001 AMC 8 Problem 10

## Problem

A collector offers to buy state quarters for 2000% of their face value. At that rate how much will Bryden get for his four state quarters?

$\text{(A)}\ 20\text{ dollars} \qquad \text{(B)}\ 50\text{ dollars} \qquad \text{(C)}\ 200\text{ dollars} \qquad \text{(D)}\ 500\text{ dollars} \qquad \text{(E)}\ 2000\text{ dollars}$

## Solution
$2000\%$ is equivalent to $20\times100\%$ . Therefore, $2000\%$ of a number is the same as $20$ times that number. $4$ quarters is $1$ dollar, so Bryden will get $20\times1={20}$ dollars, $\boxed{\text{A}}$ .

## Solution 2
Since $2000\%$ is just $\frac{2000}{100}$ , we can multiply that by $100$ , because four quarters is a $100$ cents. After the multiplication, we get $2000$ . Since our answer is in cents right now, we need to convert it to dollars, which would be $\boxed{\text{(A) 20}}$ dollars.
