# 2001 AMC 8 Problem 2

## Problem

I'm thinking of two whole numbers. Their product is 24 and their sum is 11. What is the larger number?

$\text{(A)}\ 3 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 4 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 6 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 8 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 12$

## Solution 1
Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$ . Then we have $x+y=11$ and $xy=24$ . Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x=11-y$ , and substituting this into the second equation gives $(11-y)(y)=24$ . Simplifying this gives $-y^2+11y=24$ , or $y^2-11y+24=0$ . This factors as $(y-3)(y-8)=0$ , so $y=3$ or $y=8$ , and the corresponding $x$ values are $x=8$ and $x=3$ . These are essentially the same answer: one number is $3$ and one number is $8$ , so the largest number is $8, \boxed{\text{D}}$ .

## Solution 2
Use the answers to attempt to "reverse engineer" an appropriate pair of numbers. Looking at option $A$ , guess that one of the numbers is $3$ . If the sum of two numbers is $11$ and one is $3$ , then other must be $11 - 3 = 8$ . The product of those numbers is $3\cdot 8 = 24$ , which is the second condition of the problem, so our numbers are $3$ and $8$ .
However, $3$ is the smaller of the two numbers, so the answer is $8$ or $\boxed{D}$ .

## Solution 3
We go through the divisor pairs of $24$ to see which two numbers sum to $11$ . The numbers clearly cannot be negative. If one was negative, then the other must also be negative in order to multiply to a positive product, but it would be impossible for the numbers to add up to a positive sum. So, we look at the positive divisor pairs of $24$ , namely $1$ and $24$ , $2$ and $12$ , $3$ and $8$ , and $4$ and $6$ . The only pair of numbers that sums to $11$ is $3$ and $8$ . The larger number is $8$ , so the answer is $\boxed{D}$ .
