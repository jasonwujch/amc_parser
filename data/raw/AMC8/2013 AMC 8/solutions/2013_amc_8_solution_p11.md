# 2013 AMC 8 Problem 11

## Problem

Ted's grandfather used his treadmill on 3 days this week. He went 2 miles each day. On Monday he jogged at a speed of 5 miles per hour. He walked at the rate of 3 miles per hour on Wednesday and at 4 miles per hour on Friday. If Grandfather had always walked at 4 miles per hour, he would have spent less time on the treadmill. How many minutes less?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution
We use that fact that $d=rt$ . Let d= distance, r= rate or speed, and t=time. In this case, let $x$ represent the time.
On Monday, he was at a rate of $5 \text{ m.p.h}$ . So, $5x = 2 \text{ miles}\implies x = \frac{2}{5} \text { hours}$ .
For Wednesday, he walked at a rate of $3 \text{ m.p.h}$ . Therefore, $3x = 2 \text{ miles}\implies x = \frac{2}{3} \text { hours}$ .
On Friday, he walked at a rate of $4 \text{ m.p.h}$ . So, $4x = 2 \text{ miles}\implies x=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2} \text {hours}$ .
Adding up the hours yields $\frac{2}{5} \text { hours}$ + $\frac{2}{3} \text { hours}$ + $\frac{1}{2} \text { hours}$ = $\frac{47}{30} \text { hours}$ .
We now find the amount of time Grandfather would have taken if he walked at $4 \text{ m.p.h}$ per day. Set up the equation, $4x = 2 \text{ miles} \times 3 \text{ days}\implies x = \frac{3}{2} \text { hours}$ .
To find the amount of time saved, subtract the two amounts: $\frac{47}{30} \text { hours}$ - $\frac{3}{2} \text { hours}$ = $\frac{1}{15} \text { hours}$ . To convert this to minutes, we multiply by $60$ .
Thus, the solution to this problem is $\dfrac{1}{15}\times 60=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4}$

## Short Solution In Two Short Steps!
1. Calculate the minutes he used: Monday - 1 mile = 12 minutes. Thus, he used 12x2 = 24 minutes. Wednesday - 1 mile = 20 minutes. Thus, he used 20x2 = 40 minutes. Friday - 1 mile= 15 minutes. Thus, he use 15x2 = 30 minutes. 24+40+30 = 94
2. Minus the minutes he could've used: From Friday's experience, we know two miles takes 30 minutes. 30x3 = 90 minutes. 94-90 = 4.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4{\text{}}}$
