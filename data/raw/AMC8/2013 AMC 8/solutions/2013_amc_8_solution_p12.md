# 2013 AMC 8 Problem 12

## Problem

At the 2013 Winnebago County Fair a vendor is offering a "fair special" on sandals. If you buy one pair of sandals at the regular price of $50, you get a second pair at a 40% discount, and a third pair at half the regular price. Javier took advantage of the "fair special" to buy three pairs of sandals. What percentage of the $150 regular price did he save?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 25 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 30 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 33 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 40 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 45$

## Solution
First, find the amount of money one will pay for three sandals without the discount. We have $\textdollar 50\times 3 \text{ sandals} = \textdollar 150$ .
Then, find the amount of money using the discount: $50 + 0.6 \times 50 + \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = \textdollar 105$ .
Finding the percentage yields $\frac{105}{150} = 70 \%$ .
To find the percent saved, we have $100 \% -70 \%= \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 30 \%}$
