# 2013 AMC 8 Problem 4

## Problem

Eight friends ate at a restaurant and agreed to share the bill equally. Because Judi forgot her money, each of her seven friends paid an extra $2.50 to cover her portion of the total bill. What was the total bill?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{\textdollar}120\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \text{\textdollar}128\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \text{\textdollar}140\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \text{\textdollar}144\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \text{\textdollar}160$

## Solution 1
Since Judi's 7 friends had to pay $2.50 extra each to cover the total amount that Judi should have paid, we multiply $2.50\cdot7=17.50$ is the bill Judi would have paid if she had money. Hence, to calculate the total amount, we multiply $17.50\cdot8=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 140}$ to find the total the 8 friends paid.

## Solution 2
Let $m$ be the total bill the 8 friends split up; each person was supposed to pay $$\frac{m}{8}$ . Since Judi forgot her money, we have to add $$\frac{m}{8}+2.50$ to get the amount of money each of the $7$ friends have to pay. After multipling by 7, we have $7(\frac{m}{8}+2.50)=\frac{7m}{8} + 17.5$ . This is equal to $m$ because both sides represent the total bill. Solving for $m$ : \[\frac{7m}{8} + 17.5=m\] \[\frac{m}{8}=17.5\] \[m=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 140}.\]
