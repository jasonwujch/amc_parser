## Solution

## Solution 1: Solving
First, we're going to solve for $p$ . Start with $3^p+3^4=90$ . Then, change $3^4$ to $81$ . Subtract $81$ from both sides to get $3^p=9$ and see that $p$ is $2$ . Now, solve for $r$ . Since $2^r+44=76$ , $2^r$ must equal $32$ , so $r=5$ . Now, solve for $s$ . $5^3+6^s=1421$ can be simplified to $125+6^s=1421$ which simplifies further to $6^s=1296$ . Therefore, $s=4$ . $prs$ equals $2*5*4$ which equals $40$ . So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 40}$ .

## Solution 2: Process of Elimination
First, we solve for $s$ . As Solution 1 perfectly states, $5^3+6^s=1421$ can be simplified to $125+6^s=1421$ which simplifies further to $6^s=1296$ . Therefore, $s=4$ . We know that you cannot take a root of any of the numbers raised to $p$ , $r$ , or $s$ and get a rational answer, and none of the answer choices are irrational, so that rules out the possibility that $p$ , $r$ , or $s$ is a fraction. The only answer choice that is divisible by $4$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 40}$ .
