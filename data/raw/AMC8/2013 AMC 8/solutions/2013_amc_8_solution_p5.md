# 2013 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Hammie is in $6^\text{th}$ grade and weighs 106 pounds. His quadruplet sisters are tiny babies and weigh 5, 5, 6, and 8 pounds. Which is greater, the average (mean) weight of these five children or the median weight, and by how many pounds?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{median, by 60} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \text{median, by 20} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \text{average, by 5}\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \text{average, by 15} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \text{average, by 20}$

## Solution
Listing the elements from least to greatest, we have $(5, 5, 6, 8, 106)$ , we see that the median weight is 6 pounds. The average weight of the five kids is $\frac{5+5+6+8+106}{5} = \frac{130}{5} = 26$ .
Hence, \[26-6=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ \text{average, by 20}}.\]
