# 2013 AMC 8 Problem 2

## Problem

A sign at the fish market says, "50 $\%$ off, today only: half-pound packages for just $3 per package." What is the regular price for a full pound of fish, in dollars?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 6 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 9 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 10 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 12 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution
50% off the price of half a pound of fish is $3, so 100%, the regular price, of a half pound of fish is $6. If half a pound of fish costs $6, then a whole pound of fish is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 12}$ dollars.

## Solution 2
Suppose a full pound at normal price costs $x$ dollars. Then, with the 50% off deal, the full pound would cost $x/2$ dollars. A half pound of this would cost $x/4$ dollars (including the 50% off). 50% off half a pound is 3, so we form the equation $x/4=3\Rightarrow x=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 12}$ .
