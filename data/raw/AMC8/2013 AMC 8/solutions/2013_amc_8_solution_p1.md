# 2013 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Danica wants to arrange her model cars in rows with exactly 6 cars in each row. She now has 23 model cars. What is the smallest number of additional cars she must buy in order to be able to arrange all her cars this way?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution 1
The least multiple of 6 greater than 23 is 24. So she will need to add $24-23=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 1}$ more model car. ~avamarora

## Solution 2
6 x 4 = 24, which is 1 more than 23. So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 1}$ .
