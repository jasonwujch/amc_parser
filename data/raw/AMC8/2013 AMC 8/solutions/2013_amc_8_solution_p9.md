# 2013 AMC 8 Problem 9

## Problem

The Incredible Hulk can double the distance he jumps with each succeeding jump. If his first jump is 1 meter, the second jump is 2 meters, the third jump is 4 meters, and so on, then on which jump will he first be able to jump more than 1 kilometer (1,000 meters)?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 9^\text{th} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 10^\text{th} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 11^\text{th} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 12^\text{th} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 13^\text{th}$

## Solution
This is a geometric sequence in which the common ratio is 2. To find the jump that would be over a 1000 meters, we note that $2^{10}=1024$ .
However, because the first term is $2^0=1$ and not $2^1=2$ , the solution to the problem is $10-0+1=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 11^{\text{th}}}$

## The Simple Solution
If you don't want to use your brain and wishes to use the easiest solution, here's it. We must list all the numbers times 2;
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.
Since 1024 is larger than 1000, now we just have to count the numbers. There are 11, thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 11^{\text{th}}}$
