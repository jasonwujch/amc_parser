# 2004 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

On a map, a $12$ -centimeter length represents $72$ kilometers. How many kilometers does a $17$ -centimeter length represent?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 102\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 204\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 864\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 1224$

## Solution
We set up the proportion $\frac{12 \text{cm}}{72 \text{km}}=\frac{17 \text{cm}}{x \text{km}}$ . Thus $x=102 \Rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 102}$

## Solution 2
Since we know $12$ centimeters on the map is equal to $72$ kilometers, $1$ centimeter on the map is simply $72/12$ , which is $6$ . The problem is asking how many kilometers a $17$ -centimeter length represents, so we multiply $6$ by $17$ which is simply 102, your answer.
