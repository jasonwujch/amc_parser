# 2004 AMC 8 Problem 5

## Problem

Ms. Hamilton's eighth-grade class wants to participate in the annual three-person-team basketball tournament. The losing team of each game is eliminated from the tournament. If sixteen teams compete, how many games will be played to determine the winner?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 7\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 16$

## Solution 1
Note that the winning team will the be the only team that wins all of the games. Therefore, to find the total number of games to determine the winner has a 1:1 correspondence to the number of ways to determine the losers. ( Think of it this way: If you want to select two balls from a bag of 6 balls, it is analogous to selecting the 4 balls that you don't want to select, both are 6 choose 2.). There are 15 losing teams, and since each round is unique, there are 15 total rounds.

## Solution 2
There will be $8$ games the first round, $4$ games the second round, $2$ games the third round, and $1$ game in the final round, giving us a total of $8+4+2+1=15$ games. $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 15}$ .
