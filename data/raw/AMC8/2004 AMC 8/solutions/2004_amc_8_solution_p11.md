# 2004 AMC 8 Problem 11

## Problem

The numbers $-2, 4, 6, 9$ and $12$ are rearranged according to these rules:

What is the average of the first and last numbers?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3.5 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 6.5 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 7.5 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 8$

## Solution
From rule 1, the largest number, $12$ , can be second or third. From rule 2, because there are five places, the smallest number $-2$ can either be third or fourth. The median, $6$ can be second, third, or fourth. Because we know the middle three numbers, the first and last numbers are $4$ and $9$ , disregarding their order. Their average is $(4+9)/2 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 6.5}$ .
