# 2004 AMC 8 Problem 6

## Problem

After Sally takes $20$ shots, she has made $55\%$ of her shots. After she takes $5$ more shots, she raises her percentage to $56\%$ . How many of the last $5$ shots did she make?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution
Sally made $0.55*20=11$ shots originally. Letting $x$ be the number of shots she made, we have $\frac{11+x}{25}=0.56$ . Solving for $x$ gives us $x=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3}$
