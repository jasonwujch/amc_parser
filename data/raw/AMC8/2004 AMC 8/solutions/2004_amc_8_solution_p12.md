# 2004 AMC 8 Problem 12

## Problem

Niki usually leaves her cell phone on. If her cell phone is on but she is not actually using it, the battery will last for $24$ hours. If she is using it constantly, the battery will last for only $3$ hours. Since the last recharge, her phone has been on $9$ hours, and during that time she has used it for $60$ minutes. If she doesn’t use it any more but leaves the phone on, how many more hours will the battery last?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 7 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 11 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 14 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution
When not being used, the cell phone uses up $\frac{1}{24}$ of its battery per hour. When being used, the cell phone uses up $\frac{1}{3}$ of its battery per hour. Since Niki's phone has been on for $9$ hours, of those $8$ simply on and $1$ with Niki using her phone, $8(\frac{1}{24}) + 1(\frac{1}{3}) = \frac{2}{3}$ of its battery has been used up. To drain the remaining $\frac{1}{3}$ the phone can last for $\frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{24}}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 8}$ more hours without being used.
