## Problem

Circle $X$ has a radius of $\pi$ . Circle $Y$ has a circumference of $8 \pi$ . Circle $Z$ has an area of $9 \pi$ . List the circles in order from smallest to the largest radius.

$\textbf{(A)}\ X, Y, Z\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ Z, X, Y\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ Y, X, Z\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ Z, Y, X\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ X, Z, Y$

## Solution
Using the formulas of circles, $C=2 \pi r$ and $A= \pi r^2$ , we find that circle $Y$ has a radius of $4$ and circle $Z$ has a radius of $3$ . Also, circle X has a radius of $\pi$ . Thus, the order from smallest to largest radius is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ Z, X, Y}$ .
