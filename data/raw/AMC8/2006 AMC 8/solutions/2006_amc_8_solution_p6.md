## Problem

The letter T is formed by placing two $2 \times 4$ inch rectangles next to each other, as shown. What is the perimeter of the T, in inches?

[asy] size(150); draw((0,6)--(4,6)--(4,4)--(3,4)--(3,0)--(1,0)--(1,4)--(0,4)--cycle, linewidth(1));[/asy]

$\textbf{(A)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 16\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 22\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 24$

## Solution
If the two rectangles were seperate, the perimeter would be $2(2(2+4)=24$ . It easy to see that their connection erases 2 from each of the rectangles, so the final perimeter is $24-2 \times 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 20}$ .
