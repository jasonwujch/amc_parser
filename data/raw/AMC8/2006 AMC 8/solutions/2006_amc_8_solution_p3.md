# 2006 AMC 8 Problem 3

## Problem

Elisa swims laps in the pool. When she first started, she completed 10 laps in 25 minutes. Now, she can finish 12 laps in 24 minutes. By how many minutes has she improved her lap time?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{3}{4}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 3$

## Solution
When Elisa started, she finished a lap in $\frac{25}{10}=2.5$ minutes. Now, she finishes a lap is $\frac{24}{12}= 2$ minutes. The difference is $2.5-2=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{2}}$ .
