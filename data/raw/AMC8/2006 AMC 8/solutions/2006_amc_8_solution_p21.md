# 2006 AMC 8 Problem 21

## Problem

An aquarium has a rectangular base that measures $100$ cm by $40$ cm and has a height of $50$ cm. The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of $37$ cm. A rock with volume $1000\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0.25\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 0.5\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 1.25\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 2.5$

## Solution
The water level will rise $1$ cm for every $100 \cdot 40 = 4000\text{cm}^2$ . Since $1000$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ of $4000$ , the water will rise $\frac{1}{4}\cdot1 = \boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.25}$
