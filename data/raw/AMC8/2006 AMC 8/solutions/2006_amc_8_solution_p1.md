# 2006 AMC 8 Problem 1

## Problem

Mindy made three purchases for $\textdollar 1.98$ dollars, $\textdollar 5.04$ dollars, and $\textdollar 9.89$ dollars. What was her total, to the nearest dollar?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 16\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 17\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 18$

## Solution
The three prices round to $\textdollar 2$ , $\textdollar 5$ , and $\textdollar 10$ , which have a sum of $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 17}$ .
We know that there will not be a rounding error, as the total amount rounded is clearly less than $\textdollar 0.50$ .
