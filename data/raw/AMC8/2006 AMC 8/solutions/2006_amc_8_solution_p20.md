# 2006 AMC 8 Problem 20

## Problem

A singles tournament had six players. Each player played every other player only once, with no ties. If Helen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games and Lara won 2 games, how many games did Monica win?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 4$

## Solution
Since there are 6 players, a total of $\frac{6(6-1)}{2}=15$ games are played. So far, $4+3+2+2+2=13$ games finished (one person won from each game), so Monica needs to win $15-13 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2}$ .
