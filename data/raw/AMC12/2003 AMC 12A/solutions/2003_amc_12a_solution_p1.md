# 2003 AMC 12A Problem 1

## Problem

What is the difference between the sum of the first $2003$ even counting numbers and the sum of the first $2003$ odd counting numbers?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 0\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 1\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 2\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 2003\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 4006$

## Solution 1
The first $2003$ even counting numbers are $2,4,6,...,4006$ .
The first $2003$ odd counting numbers are $1,3,5,...,4005$ .
Thus, the problem is asking for the value of $(2+4+6+...+4006)-(1+3+5+...+4005)$ .
$(2+4+6+...+4006)-(1+3+5+...+4005) = (2-1)+(4-3)+(6-5)+...+(4006-4005)$
$= 1+1+1+...+1 = \boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 2003}$
The answer is 2003

## Solution 2
Using the sum of an arithmetic progression formula, we can write this as $\frac{2003}{2}(2 + 4006) - \frac{2003}{2}(1 + 4005) = \frac{2003}{2} \cdot 2 = \boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 2003}$ .

## Solution 3
The formula for the sum of the first $n$ even numbers, is $S_E=n^{2}+n$ , (E standing for even).
Sum of first $n$ odd numbers, is $S_O=n^{2}$ , (O standing for odd).
Knowing this, plug $2003$ for $n$ ,
$S_E-S_O= (2003^{2}+2003)-(2003^{2})=2003 \Rightarrow$ $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 2003}$ .

## Solution 4
In the case that we don't know if $0$ is considered an even number, we note that it doesn't matter! The sum of odd numbers is $O=1+3+5+...+4005$ . And the sum of even numbers is either $E_1=0+2+4...+4004$ or $E_2=2+4+6+...+4006$ . When compared to the sum of odd numbers, we see that each of the $n$ th term in the series of even numbers differ by $1$ . For example, take series $O$ and $E_1$ . The first terms are $1$ and $0$ . Their difference is $|1-0|=1$ . Similarly, take take series $O$ and $E_2$ . The first terms are $1$ and $2$ . Their difference is $|1-2|=1$ . Since there are $2003$ terms in each set, the answer $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 2003}$ .

## Solution 5 (Fastest method)
We can pair each term of the sums - the first even number with the first odd number, the second with the second, and so forth. Then, there are 2003 pairs with a difference of 1 in each pair - 2-1 is 1, 4-3 is 1, 6-5 is 1, and so on. Then, the solution is $1 \cdot 2003$ , and the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) }2003}$ .
