# 2003 AMC 12A Problem 18

## Problem

Let $n$ be a $5$ -digit number, and let $q$ and $r$ be the quotient and the remainder, respectively, when $n$ is divided by $100$ . For how many values of $n$ is $q+r$ divisible by $11$ ?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 8180\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 8181\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 8182\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 9000\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 9090$

## Solution 1
When a $5$ -digit number is divided by $100$ , the first $3$ digits become the quotient, $q$ , and the last $2$ digits become the remainder, $r$ .
Therefore, $q$ can be any integer from $100$ to $999$ inclusive, and $r$ can be any integer from $0$ to $99$ inclusive.
For each of the $9\cdot10\cdot10=900$ possible values of $q$ , there are at least $\left\lfloor \frac{100}{11} \right\rfloor = 9$ possible values of $r$ such that $q+r \equiv 0\pmod{11}$ .
Since there is $1$ "extra" possible value of $r$ that is congruent to $0\pmod{11}$ , each of the $\left\lfloor \frac{900}{11} \right\rfloor = 81$ values of $q$ that are congruent to $0\pmod{11}$ have $1$ more possible value of $r$ such that $q+r \equiv 0\pmod{11}$ .
Therefore, the number of possible values of $n$ such that $q+r \equiv 0\pmod{11}$ is $900\cdot9+81\cdot1=8181 \Rightarrow\boxed{(B)}$ .

## Solution 2
Notice that $q+r\equiv0\pmod{11}\Rightarrow100q+r\equiv0\pmod{11}$ . This means that any number whose quotient and remainder sum is divisible by 11 must also be divisible by 11. Therefore, there are $\frac{99990-10010}{11}+1=8181$ possible values. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }8181}$ .

## Solution 3
Let $abcde$ be the five digits of $n$ . Then $q = abc$ and $r = de$ . By the divisibility rules of $11$ , $q = a - b + c \pmod{11}$ and $r = -d + e \pmod{11}$ , so $q + r = a - b + c - d + e = abcde = n \pmod{11}$ . Thus, $n$ must be divisble by $11$ . There are $\frac{99990 - 10010}{11} + 1 = 8181$ five-digit multiples of $11$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }8181}$ .
