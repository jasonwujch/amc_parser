## Problem

A point P is chosen at random in the interior of equilateral triangle $ABC$ . What is the probability that $\triangle ABP$ has a greater area than each of $\triangle ACP$ and $\triangle BCP$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{6}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{3}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{2}{3}$

## Solution
[asy] draw((0,10)--(8.660254037844385792,-5)--(-8.660254037844385792,-5)--cycle); dot((1.2,-0.68)); label("$P$",(1.2,-0.68),N); [/asy]

## Solution 1
After we pick point $P$ , we realize that $ABC$ is symmetric for this purpose, and so the probability that $ACP$ is the greatest area, or $ABP$ or $BCP$ , are all the same. Since they add to $1$ , the probability that $ABP$ has the greatest area is $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ \dfrac{1}{3}}$

## Solution 2
We will use geometric probability. Let us take point $P$ , and draw the perpendiculars to $BC$ , $CA$ , and $AB$ , and call the feet of these perpendiculars $D$ , $E$ , and $F$ respectively. The area of $\triangle ACP$ is simply $\frac{1}{2} * AC * PF$ . Similarly we can find the area of triangles $BCP$ and $ABP$ . If we add these up and realize that it equals the area of the entire triangle, we see that no matter where we choose $P, PD + PE + PF$ = the height of the triangle. Setting the area of triangle $ABP$ greater than $ACP$ and $BCP$ , we want $PF$ to be the largest of $PF$ , $PD$ , and $PE$ . We then realize that $PF = PD = PE$ when $P$ is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ . Let us call the incenter of the triangle $Q$ . If we want $PF$ to be the largest of the three, by testing points we realize that $P$ must be in the interior of quadrilateral $QDCE$ . So our probability (using geometric probability) is the area of $QDCE$ divided by the area of $ABC$ . We will now show that the three quadrilaterals, $QDCE$ , $QEAF$ , and $QFBD$ are congruent. As the definition of point $Q$ yields, $QF$ = $QD$ = $QE$ . Since $ABC$ is equilateral, $Q$ is also the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$ , so $QA = QB = QC$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BD = DC = CE = EA = AF = FB$ . Also, angles $BDQ, BFQ, CEQ, CDQ, AFQ$ , and $AEQ$ are all equal to $90^\circ$ . Angles $DBF, FAE, ECD$ are all equal to $60$ degrees, so it is now clear that quadrilaterals $QDCE, QEAF, QFBD$ are all congruent. Summing up these areas gives us the area of $\triangle ABC$ . $QDCE$ contributes to a third of that area so $\frac{[QDCE]}{[ABC]}=\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ \dfrac{1}{3}}$ .

## Solution 3 (Solution 1 but simpler)
Due to symmetry, we notice that the probability one triangle is greater than the other is $\frac{1}{2}$ . For two triangles this gives $\frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$ . However, the probability of one triangle being greater than the other, depends on knowing whether one triangle is greater or less than the other. This means the probability is less than $\frac{1}{2}$ but greater than $\frac{1}{4}$ giving $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ \dfrac{1}{3}}$ .
