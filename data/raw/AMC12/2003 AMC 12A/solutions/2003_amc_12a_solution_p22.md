# 2003 AMC 12A Problem 22

## Problem

Objects $A$ and $B$ move simultaneously in the coordinate plane via a sequence of steps, each of length one. Object $A$ starts at $(0,0)$ and each of its steps is either right or up, both equally likely. Object $B$ starts at $(5,7)$ and each of its steps is either to the left or down, both equally likely. Which of the following is closest to the probability that the objects meet?

$\mathrm{(A)} \ 0.10 \qquad \mathrm{(B)} \ 0.15 \qquad \mathrm{(C)} \ 0.20 \qquad \mathrm{(D)} \ 0.25 \qquad \mathrm{(E)} \ 0.30 \qquad$

## Solution 1
If $A$ and $B$ meet, their paths connect $(0,0)$ and $(5,7).$ There are $\binom{12}{5}=792$ such paths. Since the path is $12$ units long, they must meet after each travels $6$ units, so the probability is $\frac{792}{2^{6}\cdot 2^{6}} \approx 0.20 \Rightarrow \boxed{C}$ .
Note: The number of paths, $\binom{12}{5}$ comes from the fact that there must be 5 ups/downs and 7 lefts/rights in one path. WLOG, for Object A, the number of paths would be the amount of combinations of the sequence of letters with 5 "U"s 7 "R"s (i.e. UUUUURRRRRRR). This is $\frac{12!}{5!7!}$ , which is equivalent to $\binom{12}{5}$ . ~bearjere

## Solution 2 (Generating Functions)
We know that the sum of the vertical steps must be equal to $7$ . We also know that they must take $6$ steps each. Since moving vertically or horizontally is equally likely, we can write all the possible paths as a generating function:
\[P(x)=(x+1)^{12}\]
Where we need to extract the $x^5$ coefficient. By the binomial coefficient theorem, that term is $\binom{12}{5}=792$ paths. Since there are also $2^{12}$ paths, we have:
$\frac{792}{2^{12}}=\frac{792}{4096}\approx\frac{800}{4000}\approx\boxed{\text{(C) } 0.20}$

## Solution 3 (Alcumus)
Since there are twelve steps between $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$ , $A$ and $B$ can meet only after they have each moved six steps. The possible meeting places are $P_{0} = (0,6)$ , $P_{1} = (1,5)$ , $P_{2} = (2,4)$ , $P_{3}=(3,3)$ , $P_{4} = (4,2)$ , and $P_{5} = (5,1)$ . Let $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ denote the number of paths to $P_{i}$ from $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$ , respectively. Since $A$ has to take $i$ steps to the right and $B$ has to take $i+1$ steps down, the number of ways in which $A$ and $B$ can meet at $P_{i}$ is \[a_{i}\cdot b_{i} = \binom{6}{i} \binom{6}{i+1}.\] Since $A$ and $B$ can each take $2^{6}$ paths in six steps, the probability that they meet is\begin{align*} &\sum_{i = 0}^{5}\displaystyle\left ( \frac{a_{i}}{2^{6}}\displaystyle\right)\displaystyle\left( \frac{b_{i}}{2^{6}} \displaystyle\right) \\ & \qquad = \frac{\binom{6}{0}\binom{6}{1} + \binom{6}{1}\binom{6}{2} + \binom{6}{2}\binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3}\binom{6}{4}+ \binom{6}{4}\binom{6}{5} + \binom{6}{5}\binom{6}{6}}{2^{12}}\\ & \qquad = \frac{99}{512} \\ & \qquad \approx \boxed{0.20}. \end{align*} Solution 2: Consider the $\binom{12}{5}$ walks that start at $(0,0)$ , end at $(5,7)$ , and consist of 12 steps, each one either up or to the right. There is a one-to-one correspondence between these walks and the set of $(A,B)$ -paths where $A$ and $B$ meet. In particular, given one of the $\binom{12}{5}$ walks from $(0,0)$ to $(5,7)$ , the path followed by $A$ consists of the first six steps of the walk, and the path followed by $B$ is obtained by starting at $(5,7)$ and reversing the last six steps of the walk. There are $2^{6}$ paths that take 6 steps from $(0,0)$ and $2^{6}$ paths that take 6 steps from $(5,7)$ , so there are $2^{12}$ pairs of paths that $A$ and $B$ can take. The probability that they meet is\begin{align*} P&=\frac{1}{2^{12}}\binom{12}{5}\\ &=\frac{1}{2^{12}}\frac{12\cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}\\ &=\frac{99}{2^9}.\\ \end{align*}This is approximately $0.20$ , so the answer is $\boxed{C}$ .
