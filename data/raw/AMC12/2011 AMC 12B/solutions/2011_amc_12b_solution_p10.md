# 2011 AMC 12B Problem 10

## Problem

Rectangle $ABCD$ has $AB=6$ and $BC=3$ . Point $M$ is chosen on side $AB$ so that $\angle AMD=\angle CMD$ . What is the degree measure of $\angle AMD$ ?

$\textrm{(A)}\ 15 \qquad \textrm{(B)}\ 30 \qquad \textrm{(C)}\ 45 \qquad \textrm{(D)}\ 60 \qquad \textrm{(E)}\ 75$

## Solution
Since $AB \parallel CD$ , $\angle AMD = \angle CDM$ , so $\angle AMD = \angle CMD = \angle CDM$ , so $\bigtriangleup CMD$ is isosceles, and hence $CM=CD=6$ . Therefore, $\triangle BMC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with $\angle BMC = 30^\circ$ . Therefore $\angle AMD=\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 75^\circ}$
