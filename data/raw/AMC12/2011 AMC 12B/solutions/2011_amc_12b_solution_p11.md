## Problem

A frog located at $(x,y)$ , with both $x$ and $y$ integers, makes successive jumps of length $5$ and always lands on points with integer coordinates. Suppose that the frog starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(1,0)$ . What is the smallest possible number of jumps the frog makes?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 6$

## Solution
Since the frog always jumps in length $5$ and lands on a lattice point, the sum of its coordinates must change either by $5$ (by jumping parallel to the x- or y-axis), or by $3$ or $4$ (3-4-5 right triangle).
Because either $1$ , $5$ , or $7$ is always the change of the sum of the coordinates, the sum of the coordinates will always change from odd to even or vice versa. Thus, it can't go from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ in an even number of moves. Therefore, the frog cannot reach $(1,0)$ in two moves.
However, a path is possible in 3 moves: from $(0,0)$ to $(3,4)$ to $(6,0)$ to $(1,0)$ .
Thus, the answer is $= \boxed{3 \textbf{}}$ .
