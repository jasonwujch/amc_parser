## Problem

A lattice point in an $xy$ -coordinate system is any point $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are integers. The graph of $y = mx + 2$ passes through no lattice point with $0 < x \leq 100$ for all $m$ such that $\frac{1}{2} < m < a$ . What is the maximum possible value of $a$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{51}{101} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{50}{99} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{51}{100} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{52}{101} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{13}{25}$

## Solution 1
It is very easy to see that the $+2$ in the graph does not impact whether it passes through the lattice.
We need to make sure that $m$ cannot be in the form of $\frac{a}{b}$ for $1\le b\le 100$ . Otherwise, the graph $y= mx$ passes through the lattice point at $x = b$ . We only need to worry about $\frac{a}{b}$ very close to $\frac{1}{2}$ , $\frac{n+1}{2n+1}$ , $\frac{n+1}{2n}$ will be the only case we need to worry about and we want the minimum of those, clearly for $1\le b\le 100$ , the smallest is $\frac{50}{99}$ , so answer is $\boxed{\frac{50}{99} \textbf{(B)}}$ (In other words we are trying to find the smallest $m>\frac{1}{2}$ such that $b\le 100$ .)

## Solution 2
Like in the first solution, we note that the $+2$ does not affect our answer. Thus, we can ignore it and consider an equivalent problem with the line $y = mx$ .
A line with a slope of $\frac{1}{2}$ passes through (among other lattice points) the lattice point $(100,50)$ . As the slope of the line increases from $\frac{1}{2}$ , the first lattice point it hits is at $(99, 50)$ , the slope of that line being $\frac{50}{99}$ . So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$

## Solution 3
Like in the first solution, we note that the $+2$ does not affect our answer. Thus, we can ignore it and consider an equivalent problem with the line $y = mx$ .
We will start with the first answer choice. Notice how it is impossible for a line with slope $\frac{51}{101}$ to pass through a lattice point when $0 < x \leq 100$ .
However, if the slope is $\frac{50}{99}$ , then the line will pass through the point $(99, 50)$ . This sets the upper bound for $a$ as $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$ .
