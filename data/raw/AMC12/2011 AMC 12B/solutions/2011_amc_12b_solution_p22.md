# 2011 AMC 12B Problem 22

## Problem

Let $T_1$ be a triangle with side lengths $2011$ , $2012$ , and $2013$ . For $n \geq 1$ , if $T_n = \triangle ABC$ and $D, E$ , and $F$ are the points of tangency of the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ to the sides $AB$ , $BC$ , and $AC$ , respectively, then $T_{n+1}$ is a triangle with side lengths $AD, BE$ , and $CF$ , if it exists. What is the perimeter of the last triangle in the sequence $\left(T_n\right)$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1509}{8} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1509}{32} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1509}{64} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1509}{128} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{1509}{256}$

## Solution
Answer: (D)
Let $AB = c$ , $BC = a$ , and $AC = b$
Then $AD = AF$ , $BE = BD$ and $CF = CE$
Then $a = BE + CF$ , $b = AD + CF$ , $c = AD + BE$
Hence:
Note that $a + 1 = b$ and $a - 1 = c$ for $n = 1$ , I claim that it is true for all $n$ , assume for induction that it is true for some $n$ , then
Furthermore, the average for the sides is decreased by a factor of 2 each time.
So $T_n$ is a triangle with side length $\frac{2012}{2^{n- 1}} - 1$ , $\frac{2012}{2^{n-1}}$ , $\frac{2012}{2^{n-1}} + 1$
and the perimeter of such $T_n$ is $\frac{(3)(2012)}{2^{n-1}}$
Now we need to find when $T_n$ fails the triangle inequality. So we need to find the last $n$ such that $\frac{2012}{2^{n-1}} > 2$
For $n = 10$ , perimeter is $\frac{(3)(2012)}{2^{9}} = \frac{1509}{2^7} = \frac{1509}{128}$

## Solution 2
This problem is a PoP(Power of Point) Bash exercise. What I did to solve this problem was look at recursive perimeters. The first ever perimeter is $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$ . Next, by PoP, inscribing the circle gives us three new lengths, namely $AD, BE, CF$ . Denote $AD$ as $x_1$ and homogeneously the others. Then, $x_1 + x_2 = 2011, x_2 + x_3 = 2012$ , and $x_1 + x_3 = 2013$ . If we add all these equations up and divide by $2$ , we get $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2}$ . Writing this with $P_1 = 2011 + 2012 + 2013$ , we get that our new perimeter, $P_2$ , is indeed equal to $\frac{P_1}{2}$ . Similarly, by the same concept, we get that $P_3 = \frac{P_1}{4}$ and the pattern keeps going. In general, I found that for each new perimeter $P_n$ , $P_n = \frac{P_1}{2^{n-1}}$ . Now, substituting in the numerical value of $P_1$ , we get that $P_n = \frac{2011 + 2012 + 2013}{2^{n-1}}$ . If you keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, I got that: $P_n = \frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$ . This representation of a new perimeter in terms of $n$ looks very similar to the option choices, so we're on the right path. Now, all we need to do is find out the last value of $n$ when the sequence stops working. By the Triangular Inequality, we may be able to finish this off. Now, I won't go into depths here, but listing out terms and using the Triangular Inequality gives us: First Sequence: $x_1 < 2012$
$x_2 < 2013$
$x_3 < 2011$ . The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(1005, 1006, 1007)$ if you solve the PoP system of equations we got earlier. If you keep listing out terms, we can come up with the general form, and that is: $x_1 < \frac{503}{2^{n-4}}$
$x_2 < \frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1$
$x_3 < \frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1$ . The ordered triple for this set of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ is $(\frac{503}{2^{n-4}}, \frac{503}{2^{n-4}} - 1, \frac{503}{2^{n-4}} + 1)$ . Now, if we plug in these values of $x_1, x_2$ , and $x_3$ into the inequalities, we see that the first two are always satisfied, but the last one is only satisfied when: $2^{n-2} < 503$ (You will get this if you simplify the last inequality). The last $n$ for this to be satisfied is when $n = 10$ . If we go up to our general representation of $P_n$ , we see that $P_n = \frac{1509}{2^{n-3}}$ . Plugging in $10$ because this is the last $n$ (and also the last triangle), we our final answer of $\frac{1509}{2^{7}} = \boxed{\frac{1509}{128}}$ or $\boxed{D}$ .
