# 2011 AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

Let $N$ be the second smallest positive integer that is divisible by every positive integer less than $7$ . What is the sum of the digits of $N$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 6 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 9$

## Solution
$N$ must be divisible by every positive integer less than $7$ , or $1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$ and $6$ . Each number that is divisible by each of these is a multiple of their least common multiple. $LCM(1,2,3,4,5,6)=60$ , so each number divisible by these is a multiple of $60$ . The smallest multiple of $60$ is $60$ , so the second smallest multiple of $60$ is $2\times60=120$ . Therefore, the sum of the digits of $N$ is $1+2+0=\boxed{3\ \textbf{(A)}}$
