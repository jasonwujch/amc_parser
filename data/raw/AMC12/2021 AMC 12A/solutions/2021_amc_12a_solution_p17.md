## Solution 1 (Similar Triangles and Pythagorean Theorem)
Angle chasing* reveals that $\triangle BPC\sim\triangle BDA$ , therefore \[2=\frac{BD}{BP}=\frac{AB}{BC}=\frac{AB}{43},\] or $AB=86$ .
Additional angle chasing shows that $\triangle ABO\sim\triangle CDO$ , therefore \[2=\frac{AB}{CD}=\frac{BO}{OD}=\frac{BP+11}{BP-11},\] or $BP=33$ and $BD=66$ .
Since $\triangle ADB$ is right, the Pythagorean theorem implies that \[AD=\sqrt{86^2-66^2}=4\sqrt{190}.\] The answer is $4+190=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }194}$ .
- Angle Chasing: If we set $\angle DBC = \alpha$ , then we know that $\angle DCB = 180^\circ-2\alpha$ because $\triangle DBC$ is isosceles. Then, $\angle BCP = 90^\circ-\alpha$ , so $\angle BPC$ is a right angle. Because $\angle BDC = \alpha$ and $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{DC}$ , we conclude that $\angle ABD = \alpha$ too. Lastly, because $\triangle BPC$ and $\triangle BDA$ are both right triangles, they are similar by AA.

## Solution 2 (Similar Triangles, Areas, Pythagorean Theorem)
Since $\triangle BCD$ is isosceles with base $\overline{BD},$ it follows that median $\overline{CP}$ is also an altitude. Let $OD=x$ and $CP=h,$ so $PB=x+11.$
Since $\angle AOD=\angle COP$ by vertical angles, we conclude that $\triangle AOD\sim\triangle COP$ by AA, from which $\frac{AD}{CP}=\frac{OD}{OP},$ or \[AD=CP\cdot\frac{OD}{OP}=h\cdot\frac{x}{11}.\] Let the brackets denote areas. Notice that $[AOD]=[BOC]$ (By the same base and height, we deduce that $[ACD]=[BDC].$ Subtracting $[OCD]$ from both sides gives $[AOD]=[BOC].$ ). Doubling both sides produces \begin{align*} 2[AOD]&=2[BOC] \\ OD\cdot AD&=OB\cdot CP \\ x\left(\frac{hx}{11}\right)&=(x+22)h \\ x^2&=11(x+22). \end{align*} Rearranging and factoring result in $(x-22)(x+11)=0,$ from which $x=22.$
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to right $\triangle CPB,$ we have \[h=\sqrt{43^2-33^2}=\sqrt{(43+33)(43-33)}=\sqrt{760}=2\sqrt{190}.\] Finally, we get \[AD=h\cdot\frac{x}{11}=4\sqrt{190},\] so the answer is $4+190=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }194}.$

## Solution 3 (Short)
Let $CP = y$ . $CP$ a is perpendicular bisector of $DB.$ Then, let $DO = x,$ thus $DP = PB = 11+x.$
(1) $\triangle CPO \sim \triangle ADO,$ so we get $\frac{AD}{x} = \frac{y}{11},$ or $AD = \frac{xy}{11}.$
(2) Applying Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle CDP$ gives $(11+x)^2 + y^2 = 43^2.$
(3) $\triangle BPC \sim \triangle BDA$ with ratio $1:2,$ so $AD = 2y$ using the fact that $P$ is the midpoint of $BD$ .
Thus, $\frac{xy}{11} = 2y,$ or $x = 22.$ And $y = \sqrt{43^2 - 33^2} = 2 \sqrt{190},$ so $AD = 4 \sqrt{190}$ and the answer is $4+190=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }194}.$

## Solution 4 (Law of Sines and Similar Triangles)
This solution will refer to the diagram section at the top of this page.
We know $\angle ABD = \angle BDC = \angle DBC$ . Let $PB = 11 + x$ . Notice that $\triangle ABD$ is similar to $\triangle DOC$ , so $\frac{AB}{43} = \frac{22 + x}{x} \implies AB = \frac{43(22 + x)}{x}$ . Now we apply the Law of Sines to isosceles triangle $\triangle DCB$ :
\[\frac{\sin(\angle ABD)}{43} = \frac{\sin(180^\circ - 2\angle ABD)}{22 + 2x} = \frac{2\sin(\angle ABD)\cos(\angle ABD)}{22 + 2x}\]
\[\frac{1}{43} = \frac{\cos(\angle ABD)}{11 + x} \implies \cos(\angle ABD) = \frac{11 + x}{43}\]
From right triangle $\triangle BAD$ we already know that $\cos(\angle ABD) = \frac{BD}{AB} = \frac{(22 + 2x)x}{43(22 + x)}$ .
Setting these equations equal to each other gives us: \[\frac{(22 + 2x)x}{43(22 + x)} = \frac{11 + x}{43}\]
\[x = 22 \implies BD = 2(11 + x) = 66, AB = \frac{43 \cdot 44}{22} = 86.\]
So $AD = \sqrt{86^2 - 66^2} = 4\sqrt{190}$ . Ans = $\boxed{194}$ .

## Solution 5 (Extending the Line)
Observe that $\triangle BPC$ is congruent to $\triangle DPC$ ; both are similar to $\triangle BDA$ . Let's extend $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ past points $D$ and $C$ respectively, such that they intersect at a point $E$ . Observe that $\angle BDE$ is $90$ degrees, and that $\angle DBE \cong \angle PBC \cong \angle DBA \implies \angle DBE \cong \angle DBA$ . Thus, by ASA, we know that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle EBD$ , thus, $AD = ED$ , meaning $D$ is the midpoint of $AE$ . Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{DE}$ . Note that $\triangle CME$ is congruent to $\triangle BPC$ , thus $BC = CE$ , meaning $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BE}.$
Therefore, $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ are both medians of $\triangle ABE$ . This means that $O$ is the centroid of $\triangle ABE$ ; therefore, because the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, $\frac{BO}{2} = DO = \frac{BD}{3}$ . Recall that $P$ is the midpoint of $BD$ ; $DP = \frac{BD}{2}$ . The question tells us that $OP = 11$ ; $DP-DO=11$ ; we can write this in terms of $DB$ ; $\frac{DB}{2}-\frac{DB}{3} = \frac{DB}{6} = 11 \implies DB = 66$ .
We are almost finished. Each side length of $\triangle ABD$ is twice as long as the corresponding side length $\triangle CBP$ or $\triangle CPD$ , since those triangles are similar; this means that $AB = 2 \cdot 43 = 86$ . Now, by Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle ABD$ , $AB^{2} - BD^{2} = AD^{2} \implies 86^{2}-66^{2} = AD^{2} \implies AD = \sqrt{3040} \implies AD = 4 \sqrt{190}$ .
The answer is $4+190 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }194}$ .

## Solution 6
Since $P$ is the midpoint of isosceles triangle $BCD$ , it would be pretty easy to see that $CP\perp BD$ . Since $AD\perp BD$ as well, $AD\parallel CP$ . Connecting $AP$ , it’s obvious that $[ADC]=[ADP]$ . Since $DP=BP$ , $[APB]=[ADC]$ .
Since $P$ is the midpoint of $BD$ , the height of $\triangle APB$ on side $AB$ is half that of $\triangle ADC$ on $CD$ . Since $[APB]=[ADC]$ , $AB=2CD$ .
As a basic property of a trapezoid, $\triangle AOB \sim \triangle COD$ , so $\frac{OB}{OD}=\frac{AB}{CD}=2$ , or $OB=2OD$ . Letting $OD=x$ , then $PB=DP=11+x$ , and $OB=22+x$ . Hence $22+x=2x$ and $x=22$ .
Since $\triangle AOD \sim \triangle COP$ , $\frac{AD}{PC}=\frac{OD}{OP}=2$ . Since $PD=11+22=33$ , $PC=\sqrt{43^2-33^2}=\sqrt{760}$ .
So, $AD=2\sqrt{760}=4\sqrt{190}$ . The correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }194}$ .

## Solution 7 (Coordinate Geometry)
Let $D$ be the origin of the cartesian coordinate plane, $B$ lie on the positive $x$ -axis, and $A$ lie on the negative $y$ -axis. Then let the coordinates of $B = (2a,0), A = (0, -2b).$ Then the slope of $AB$ is $\frac{b}{a}.$ Since $AB \parallel CD$ the slope of $CD$ is the same. Note that as $\triangle DCB$ is isosceles $C$ lies on $x = a.$ Thus since $CD$ has equation $y = \frac{b}{a}x$ ( $D$ is the origin), $C = (a,b).$ Therefore $AC$ has equation $y = \frac{3b}{a}x - 2b$ and intersects $BD$ ( $x$ -axis) at $O =\left(\frac{2}{3}a, 0\right).$ The midpoint of $BD$ is $P = (a,0),$ so $OP = \frac{a}{3} = 11,$ from which $a = 33.$ Then by Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle DPC$ ( $\triangle DBC$ is isosceles), we have $b = \sqrt{43^2 - 33^2} = 2\sqrt{190},$ so $2b=4\sqrt{190}.$
Finally, the answer is $4+190=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }194}.$

## Solution 8 (Trigonometry)
set $\angle BDC = \theta$
$BD = 2*DP = 2*43*\cos{\theta}$
$AB = \frac{BD}{\cos{\angle {DBA}}} = \frac{BD}{\cos{\theta}}= 2 \cdot 43 \cdot \frac{\cos{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}=86$
$\frac{OP}{DO}=\frac{CP}{AD}$
$\frac{11}{43\cdot \cos{\theta}-11}=\frac{43\cdot\sin{\theta}}{86\cdot \sin{\theta}}$
$\cos{\theta}=\frac{33}{43}$
$AD=86\cdot \sin{\theta}=2 \sqrt{760}=4\sqrt{190}=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}194}$ .
