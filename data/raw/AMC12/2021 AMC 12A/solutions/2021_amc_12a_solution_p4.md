# 2021 AMC 12A Problem 4

## Problem

Tom has a collection of $13$ snakes, $4$ of which are purple and $5$ of which are happy. He observes that

- all of his happy snakes can add,

- none of his purple snakes can subtract, and

- all of his snakes that can't subtract also can't add.

Which of these conclusions can be drawn about Tom's snakes?

$\textbf{(A) }$ Purple snakes can add.

$\textbf{(B) }$ Purple snakes are happy.

$\textbf{(C) }$ Snakes that can add are purple.

$\textbf{(D) }$ Happy snakes are not purple.

$\textbf{(E) }$ Happy snakes can't subtract.

## Solution 1 (Comprehensive Explanation of Logic)
We are given that \begin{align*} \text{happy}&\Longrightarrow\text{can add}, &(1) \\ \text{purple}&\Longrightarrow\text{cannot subtract}, \hspace{15mm} &(2) \\ \text{cannot subtract}&\Longrightarrow\text{cannot add}. &(3) \end{align*} Two solutions follow from here:

## Solution 1.1 (Intuitive)
Combining $(2)$ and $(3)$ gives \begin{align*} \text{happy}&\Longrightarrow\text{can add}, &(1) \\ \lefteqn{\underbrace{\phantom{\text{purple}\Longrightarrow\text{cannot subtract}}}_{(2)}}\text{purple}&\Longrightarrow\overbrace{\text{cannot subtract}\Longrightarrow\text{cannot add}}^{(3)}. \hspace{2.5mm} &(*) \end{align*} Clearly, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}.$

## Solution 1.2 (Rigorous)
Recall that every conditional statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive
Combining $(1),(2)$ and $(3)$ gives \[\lefteqn{\underbrace{\phantom{\text{purple}\Longrightarrow\text{cannot subtract}}}_{(2)}}\text{purple}\Longrightarrow\overbrace{\text{cannot subtract}\Longrightarrow\lefteqn{\underbrace{\phantom{\text{cannot add}\Longrightarrow\text{not happy}}}_{\text{Contrapositive of }(1)}}\text{cannot add}}^{(3)}\Longrightarrow\text{not happy}. \hspace{15mm}(**)\] Applying the hypothetical syllogism to $(**),$ we conclude that \[\text{purple}\Longrightarrow\text{not happy},\] whose contrapositive is \[\text{happy}\Longrightarrow\text{not purple}.\] Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}.$
Remark
The conclusions in the other choices do not follow from $(**):$
$\textbf{(A) }\text{purple}\Longrightarrow\text{can add}$
$\textbf{(B) }\text{purple}\Longrightarrow\text{happy}$
$\textbf{(C) }\text{can add}\Longrightarrow\text{purple}$
$\textbf{(E) }\text{happy}\Longrightarrow\text{cannot subtract}$

## Solution 2 (Process of Elimination)
From Solution 1.1, we can also see this through the process of elimination. Statement $A$ is false because purple snakes cannot add. $B$ is false as well because since happy snakes can add and purple snakes can not add, purple snakes are not happy snakes. $E$ is false using the same reasoning, purple snakes are not happy snakes so happy snakes can subtract since purple snakes cannot subtract. $C$ is false since snakes that can add are happy, not purple. That leaves statement D. $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$ is the only correct statement.

## Solution 3 (Rigorous)
We first convert each statement to "If X, then Y" form:
- If a snake is happy, then it can add.
- If a snake is purple, then it can't subtract.
- If a snake can't subtract, then it can't add.
Now, we simply check the truth value for each statement:
1. Combining the last two propositions, we have If a snake is purple, then it can't add. Thus, $\textbf{(A)}$ is never true.
1. From the last part, we found that If a snake is purple, then it can't add. Also, since the contrapositive of a proposition has the same truth value as the proposition itself, we know, from the first statement, that If a snake can't add, then it isn't happy. Combining these two propositions, we find that If a snake is purple, then it isn't happy. Purple snakes are not happy. Thus, $\textbf{(B)}$ is never true.
1. From part $\textbf{(A)},$ we found that "If a snake is purple, then it can't add." This implies its contrapositive, "If a snake can add, then it is not purple." is true, meaning $\textbf{(C)}$ is NEVER true. [Thanks again to MRENTHUSIASM for pointing this out!]
1. From the first statement, we have If a snake is happy, then it can add. From the contrapositive of the third statement, we have If a snake can add, then it can subtract. Then, from the contrapositive of the second statement, we have If a snake can subtract, then it is not purple. Combining all of these yields If a snake is happy, then it is not purple. Thus, $\textbf{(D)}$ is always true.
1. From the first proposition, we have If a snake is happy, then it can add. From the contrapositive of the third proposition, we have If a snake can add, then it can subtract. Combining these two propositions gives If a snake is happy, then it can subtract. Thus, $\textbf{(E)}$ is never true.
- If a snake is purple, then it can't add.
- If a snake is purple, then it can't add.
- If a snake can't add, then it isn't happy.
- If a snake is purple, then it isn't happy. Purple snakes are not happy.
- If a snake is happy, then it can add.
- If a snake can add, then it can subtract.
- If a snake can subtract, then it is not purple.
- If a snake is happy, then it is not purple.
- If a snake is happy, then it can add.
- If a snake can add, then it can subtract.
- If a snake is happy, then it can subtract.
Therefore, $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$ is our answer.
