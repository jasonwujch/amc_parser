# 2021 AMC 12A Problem 2

## Problem

Under what conditions is $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=a+b$ true, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers?

$\textbf{(A) }$ It is never true.

$\textbf{(B) }$ It is true if and only if $ab=0$ .

$\textbf{(C) }$ It is true if and only if $a+b\ge 0$ .

$\textbf{(D) }$ It is true if and only if $ab=0$ and $a+b\ge 0$ .

$\textbf{(E) }$ It is always true.

## Solution 1 (Algebra)
One can square both sides to get $a^{2}+b^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$ . Then, $0=2ab\implies ab=0$ . Also, it is clear that both sides of the equation must be nonnegative. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$ .

## Solution 2 (Algebra)
Complete the square of the left side by rewriting the radical to be \[\sqrt{(a+b)^{2}-2ab}.\] From there it is evident for the square root of the left to be equal to the right, $ab$ must be equal to zero. Also, we know that the equivalency of square root values only holds true for nonnegative values of $a+b$ , making the correct answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}.$

## Solution 3 (Process of Elimination)
The left side of the original equation is the arithmetic square root , which is always nonnegative. So, we need $a+b\ge 0,$ which refutes $\textbf{(B)}$ and $\textbf{(E)}.$ Next, picking $(a,b)=(0,0)$ refutes $\textbf{(A)},$ and picking $(a,b)=(1,2)$ refutes $\textbf{(C)}.$ By POE (Process of Elimination), the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}.$

## Solution 4 (Graphing)
If we graph $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=x+y,$ then we get the union of:
- positive $x$ -axis
- positive $y$ -axis
- origin
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}.$
The graph of $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=x+y$ is shown below.
