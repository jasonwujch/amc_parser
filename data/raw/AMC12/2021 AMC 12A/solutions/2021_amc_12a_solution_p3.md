# 2021 AMC 12A Problem 3

## Problem

The sum of two natural numbers is $17{,}402$ . One of the two numbers is divisible by $10$ . If the units digit of that number is erased, the other number is obtained. What is the difference of these two numbers?

$\textbf{(A)} ~10{,}272\qquad\textbf{(B)} ~11{,}700\qquad\textbf{(C)} ~13{,}362\qquad\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238\qquad\textbf{(E)} ~15{,}426$

## Solution 1 (Algebra)
The units digit of a multiple of $10$ will always be $0$ . We add a $0$ whenever we multiply by $10$ . So, removing the units digit is equal to dividing by $10$ .
Let the smaller number (the one we get after removing the units digit) be $a$ . This means the bigger number would be $10a$ .
We know the sum is $10a+a = 11a$ so $11a=17402$ . So $a=1582$ . The difference is $10a-a = 9a$ . So, the answer is $9(1582) = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238}$ .

## Solution 2 (Arithmetic)
Since the unit's place of a multiple of $10$ is $0$ , the other integer must end with a $2$ , for both integers sum up to a number ending in a $2$ . Thus, the unit's place of the difference must be $10-2=8$ , and the only answer choice that ends with an $8$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238}$ .
Another quick solution is to realize that the sum represents a number $n$ added to $10n$ . The difference is $9n$ , which is $\frac{9}{11}$ of the given sum.

## Solution 3 (Vertical Addition and Logic)
Let the larger number be $\underline{AB{,}CD0}.$ It follows that the smaller number is $\underline{A{,}BCD}.$ Adding vertically, we have \[\begin{array}{cccccc} & A & B & C & D & 0 \\ +\quad & & A & B & C & D \\ \hline & & & & & \\ [-2.5ex] & 1 & 7 & 4 & 0 & 2 \\ \end{array}\] Working from right to left, we get \[D=2\implies C=8 \implies B=5 \implies A=1.\] The larger number is $15{,}820$ and the smaller number is $1{,}582.$ Their difference is $15{,}820-1{,}582=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238}.$

## Solution 4 (Logic)
We know that the larger number has a units digit of $0$ since it is divisible by 10. If $D$ is the ten's digit of the larger number, then $D$ is the units digit of the smaller number. Since the sum of the natural numbers has a unit's digit of $2$ , $D=2$ .
The units digit of the larger number is $0$ and the units digit of the smaller number is $2$ , so the positive difference between the numbers is 8. There is only one answer choice that has this units digit, and that is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238}.$
