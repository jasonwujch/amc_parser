## Problem

What is the value of \[2^{1+2+3}-(2^1+2^2+2^3)?\] $\textbf{(A) }0 \qquad \textbf{(B) }50 \qquad \textbf{(C) }52 \qquad \textbf{(D) }54 \qquad \textbf{(E) }57$

## Solution
We evaluate the given expression to get that \[2^{1+2+3}-(2^1+2^2+2^3)=2^6-(2^1+2^2+2^3)=64-2-4-8=50 \implies \boxed{\text{(B)}}\]
