# 2022 AMC 12A Problem 2

## Problem

The sum of three numbers is $96.$ The first number is $6$ times the third number, and the third number is $40$ less than the second number. What is the absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers?

$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 2 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 4 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 5$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ be the third number. It follows that the first number is $6x,$ and the second number is $x+40.$
We have \[6x+(x+40)+x=8x+40=96,\] from which $x=7.$
Therefore, the first number is $42,$ and the second number is $47.$ Their absolute value of the difference is $|42-47|=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 5}.$

## Solution 2
Solve this using a system of equations. Let $x,y,$ and $z$ be the three numbers, respectively. We get three equations: \begin{align*} x+y+z&=96, \\ x&=6z, \\ z&=y-40. \end{align*} Rewriting the third equation gives us $y=z+40,$ so we can substitute $x$ as $6z$ and $y$ as $z+40.$
Therefore, we get \begin{align*} 6z+(z+40)+z&=96 \\ 8z+40&=96 \\ 8z&=56 \\ z&=7. \end{align*} Substituting 7 in for $z$ gives us $x=6z=6(7)=42$ and $y=z+40=7+40=47.$
So, the answer is $|x-y|=|42-47|=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 5}.$

## Solution 3
In accordance with Solution 2, \[y = z+40, x = 6z \implies |x-y| = |6z - z - 40| = 5|z - 8| \implies \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 5}.\] vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss
