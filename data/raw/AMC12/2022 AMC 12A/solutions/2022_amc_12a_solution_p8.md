## Problem

The infinite product \[\sqrt[3]{10} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots\] evaluates to a real number. What is that number?

$\textbf{(A) }\sqrt{10}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\sqrt[3]{100}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\sqrt[4]{1000}\qquad\textbf{(D) }10\qquad\textbf{(E) }10\sqrt[3]{10}$

## Solution 1
We can write $\sqrt[3]{10}$ as $10 ^ \frac{1}{3}$ . Similarly, $\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}} = (10 ^ \frac{1}{3}) ^ \frac{1}{3} = 10 ^ \frac{1}{3^2}$ .
By continuing this, we get the form \[10 ^ \frac{1}{3} \cdot 10 ^ \frac{1}{3^2} \cdot 10 ^ \frac{1}{3^3} \cdots,\] which is \[10 ^ {\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \cdots}.\] Using the formula for an infinite geometric series $S = \frac{a}{1-r}$ , we get \[\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \cdots = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1-\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{2}.\] Thus, our answer is $10 ^ \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }\sqrt{10}}$ .

## Solution 2
We can write this infinite product as $L$ (we know from the answer choices that the product must converge): \[L = \sqrt[3]{10} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots.\] If we raise everything to the third power, we get: \[L^3 = 10 \, \cdot \, \sqrt[3]{10} \, \cdot \, \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdots = 10L \implies L^3 - 10L = 0 \implies L \in \left\{0, \pm \sqrt{10}\right\}.\] Since $L$ is positive (as it is an infinite product of positive numbers), it must be that $L = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }\sqrt{10}}.$

## Solution 3
Move the first term inside the second radical. We get \[\sqrt[3]{10} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots = \sqrt[3]{10\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots.\] Do this for the third radical as well: \[\sqrt[3]{10\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots = \sqrt[3]{10\sqrt[3]{10}\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots = \sqrt[3]{10\sqrt[3]{10\sqrt[3]{10\cdots}}}.\] It is clear what the pattern is. Setting the answer as $P,$ we have \[P = \sqrt[3]{10P},\] from which $P = \boxed{\sqrt{10}}.$

## Solution 4
Set the product equal to P. We get \[\sqrt[3]{10} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots=P\] Since this is an infinite product, there may exist a clever manipulation where we set two different espressions involving $P$ equal, from which we could solve for a number. Since all terms are raised to the $\frac{1}{3}$ power, we can cube both sides of our equation. We would get \[10 \cdot \sqrt[3]{10} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{10}}} \cdots=P^3\] From this, we know that $\frac{P^3}{10}=P$ , and to this equation, the only solution is $P = \boxed{\sqrt{10}}$
