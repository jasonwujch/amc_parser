## Problem

What is the product of all real numbers $x$ such that the distance on the number line between $\log_6x$ and $\log_69$ is twice the distance on the number line between $\log_610$ and $1$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 10 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 18 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 25 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 36 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 81$

## Solution 1
Let $a = 2 \cdot |\log_6 10 - 1| = |\log_6 9 - \log_6 x| = \left|\log_6 \frac{9}{x}\right|$ .
$\pm a = \log_6 \frac{9}{x} \implies 6^{\pm a} = b^{\pm 1} = \frac{9}{x} \implies x = 9 \cdot b^{\pm 1}$
$9b^1 \cdot 9b^{-1} = \boxed{81}$ .

## Solution 2
First, notice that there must be two such numbers: one greater than $\log_69$ and one less than it. Furthermore, they both have to be the same distance away, namely $2(\log_610 - 1)$ . Let these two numbers be $\log_6a$ and $\log_6b$ . Because they are equidistant from $\log_69$ , we have $\frac{\log_6a + \log_6b}{2} = \log_69$ . Using log properties, this simplifies to $\log_6{\sqrt{ab}} = \log_69$ . We then have $\sqrt{ab} = 9$ , so $ab = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 81}$ .

## Solution 3 (Logarithmic Rules and Casework)
In effect we must find all $x$ such that $\left|\log_6 9 - \log_6 x\right| = 2d$ where $d = \log_6 10 - 1$ .
Notice that by log rules \[d = \log_6 10 - 1 = \log_6 \frac{10}{6}\] Using log rules again, \[2d = 2\log_6 \frac{10}{6} = \log_6 \frac{25}{9}\]
Now we proceed by casework for the distinct values of $x$ .
### Case 1
\[\log_6 9 - \log_6 x_1 = 2d\] Subbing in for $2d$ and using log rules, \[\log_6 \frac{9}{x_1} = \log_6 \frac{25}{9}\] From this we may conclude that \[\frac{9}{x_1} = \frac{25}{9} \implies x_1 = \frac{81}{25}\]
### Case 2
\[\log_6 9 - \log_6 x_2 = -2d\] Subbing in for $-2d$ and using log rules, \[\log_6 \frac{9}{x_2} = \log_6 \frac{9}{25}\] From this we conclude that \[\frac{9}{x_2} = \frac{9}{25} \implies x_2 = 25\]
Finding the product of the distinct values, $x_1x_2 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 81}$
