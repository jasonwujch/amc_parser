# 2022 AMC 12A Problem 10

## Problem

How many ways are there to split the integers $1$ through $14$ into $7$ pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least $2$ times the lesser number?

$\textbf{(A) } 108 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 120 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 126 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 132 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 144$

## Solution 1 (Multiplication Principle)
Clearly, the integers from $8$ through $14$ must be in different pairs, so are the integers from $1$ through $7.$ Note that $7$ must pair with $14.$
We pair the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with the numbers $8,9,10,11,12,13$ systematically:
- $6$ can pair with either $12$ or $13.$
- $5$ can pair with any of the three remaining numbers from $10,11,12,13.$
- $1,2,3,4$ can pair with the other four remaining numbers from $8,9,10,11,12,13$ without restrictions.
Together, the answer is $2\cdot3\cdot4!=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 144}.$

## Solution 2 (Multiplication Principle)
As said in Solution 1, clearly, the integers from $8$ through $14$ must be in different pairs.
We know that $8$ or $9$ can pair with any integer from $1$ to $4$ , $10$ or $11$ can pair with any integer from $1$ to $5$ , and $12$ or $13$ can pair with any integer from $1$ to $6$ . Thus, $8$ will have $4$ choices to pair with, $9$ will then have $3$ choices to pair with ( $9$ cannot pair with the same number as the one $8$ pairs with). $10$ cannot pair with the numbers $8$ and $9$ has paired with but can also now pair with $5$ , so there are $3$ choices. $11$ cannot pair with $8$ 's, $9$ 's, or $10$ 's paired numbers, so there will be $2$ choices for $11$ . $12$ can pair with an integer from $1$ to $5$ that hasn't been paired with already, or it can pair with $6$ . $13$ will only have one choice left, and $7$ must pair with $14$ .
So, the answer is $4\cdot3\cdot3\cdot2\cdot2\cdot1\cdot1=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 144}.$

## Solution 3 (Generalization)
The integers $x \in \{8, \ldots , 14 \}$ must each be the larger elements of a distinct pair.
Assign partners in decreasing order for $x \in \{7, \dots, 1\}$ :
Note that $7$ must pair with $14$ : $\mathbf{1} \textbf{ choice}$ .
For $5 \leq x \leq 7$ , the choices are $\{2x, \dots, 14\} - \{ \text{previous choices}\}$ . As $x$ decreases by 1, The minuend increases by 2 elements, and the subtrahend increases by 1 element, so the difference increases by 1, yielding $\mathbf{3!} \textbf{ combined choices}$ .
After assigning a partner to $5$ , there are no invalid pairings for yet-unpaired numbers, so there are $\mathbf{4!} \textbf{ ways}$ to choose partners for $\{1,2,3,4\}$ .
The answer is $3! \cdot 4! = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 144}$ .
In general, for $1,\ldots,2n$ , the same logic yields answer: $\left\lfloor\dfrac{n}{2}\right\rfloor! \cdot \left\lceil\dfrac{n}{2}\right\rceil!$
