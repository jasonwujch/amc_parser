## Problem

Let $T_k$ be the transformation of the coordinate plane that first rotates the plane $k$ degrees counterclockwise around the origin and then reflects the plane across the $y$ -axis. What is the least positive integer $n$ such that performing the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \cdots, T_n$ returns the point $(1,0)$ back to itself?

$\textbf{(A) } 359 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 360 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 719 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 720 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 721$

## Solution 1
Let $P=(r,\theta)$ be a point in polar coordinates, where $\theta$ is in degrees.
Rotating $P$ by $k^{\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin gives the transformation $(r,\theta)\rightarrow(r,\theta+k^{\circ}).$ Reflecting $P$ across the $y$ -axis gives the transformation $(r,\theta)\rightarrow(r,180^{\circ}-\theta).$ Note that \begin{align*} T_k(P)&=(r,180^{\circ}-\theta-k^{\circ}), \\ T_{k+1}(T_k(P)) &= (r,\theta -1^{\circ}). \end{align*} We start with $(1,0^{\circ})$ in polar coordinates. For the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \cdots, T_k,$ it follows that
- After $T_1,$ we have $(1,179^{\circ}).$
- After $T_2,$ we have $(1,-1^{\circ}).$
- After $T_3,$ we have $(1,178^{\circ}).$
- After $T_4,$ we have $(1,-2^{\circ}).$
- After $T_5,$ we have $(1,177^{\circ}).$
- After $T_6,$ we have $(1,-3^{\circ}).$
- ...
- After $T_{2k-1},$ we have $(1,180^{\circ}-k^{\circ}).$
- After $T_{2k},$ we have $(1,-k^{\circ}).$
The least such positive integer $k$ is $180.$ Therefore, the least such positive integer $n$ is $2k-1=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 359}.$

## Solution 2
Note that since we're reflecting across the $y$ -axis, if the point ever makes it to $(-1,0)$ then it will flip back to the original point. Note that after $T_1$ the point will be $1$ degree clockwise from the negative $x$ -axis. Applying $T_2$ will rotate it to be $1$ degree counterclockwise from the negative $x$ -axis, and then flip it so that it is $1$ degree clockwise from the positive $x$ -axis. Therefore, after every $2$ transformations, the point rotates $1$ degree clockwise. To rotate it so that it will rotate $179$ degrees clockwise will require $179 \cdot 2 = 358$ transformations. Then finally on the last transformation, it will rotate on to $(-1,0)$ and then flip back to its original position. Therefore, the answer is $358+1 = 359 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 359}$ .

## Solution 3
So, you don't know polar coordinates (Solution 1) nor came up with Solution 2's logic, then, here we go!
The easy solution is to notice that, without reflections and taking \( k=1 \), there are 360 turns that need to be made.
Now take \( k=2 \). We see that there are 180 rotations, so the number of rotations is just \( 360/k \).
Now include the reflections over the \( y \) axis.
Say that each time we reflect a point over the \( y \) axis, we draw a line.
Each time we reflect over the \( y\) axis, we see more and more lines that generate. For \( k=1 \), there are quite obviously 360 of these lines.
However, one can see that this works for every single case, because when we reflect it over the \( y\) axis and make a \( k^\circ \) rotation, we fill up all the missed gaps until we reach the end of a sequence - I prove this on section 1.1.
But wait! We overcounted by one line! Notice how I said there were 360 lines, but the line \(x=1\) intersects \( y=0\) is already given to you, and that is when \(T_k = 0\), which is the point \( (1, 0) \)! So our final answer is \( 360-1 = \) $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 359}.$

### Proof
A way you can prove such an assumption is by taking ideas like addition. We know that eventually there exists a number \( N \) such that \( l \times N = m \), where \( m \) has a units digit of \( l \). Utilizing the same approach, we can find that this actually works.

## Solution 4
In degrees:
Starting with $n=0$ , the sequence goes ${0}\rightarrow {179}\rightarrow {359}\rightarrow {178}\rightarrow {358}\rightarrow {177}\rightarrow {357}\rightarrow\cdots.$
We see that it takes $2$ steps to downgrade the point by $1^{\circ}$ . Since the $1$ st point in the sequence is ${179}$ , the answer is $1+2(179)=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 359}.$

## Solution 5 (Simple)
We can consider the rotations and reflections separately. For the rotations, each rotation turns it by the next natural number. Thus the total number of degrees turned would be a triangle number. We test the smallest number, $359$ first, and we get that it turns $\frac{(1+359)359}{2} = 180n$ , where $n$ is an integer. Thus, the point would be rotated to $(-1,0)$ . We may be tempted to dismiss this option but we haven't considered the reflections. Each reflection acts as a $180^{\circ}$ rotation, so every two reflections cancel. However, $359$ is odd so we have to reflect $(-1,0)$ , taking us to $(1,0)$ , which is what we want. Thus we get $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 359}$ .

## Solution 6 (Complex)
Rotations and reflections in 2D are very nice to describe using complex numbers in polar form. Reflections and rotations also don't affect the length (modulus or absolute value) of a complex number. This motivates us to set $z = \exp (i\theta)$ , starting with $z=1+0i=\exp(i0)$ . Then, we can describe rotations and reflections about the $y$ -axis using these formulas: \[\text{Rotation}(\exp(i\theta), k): \exp(i\theta) \mapsto \exp(i(\theta + k))\] \[\text{Reflection}(\exp(i\theta)): \exp(i\theta) \mapsto \exp i (180^\circ - \theta) = -\exp(i(-\theta))\]
If we apply two successive iterations, we see a simplification:
\[T_k(\exp(i\theta)) = -\exp(-i(\theta+k))\]
\begin{aligned} T_{k+1}(T_k(\exp(i\theta))) &= T_{k+1}(-\exp(i(-\theta-k)) \\ &= --\exp(-i(-\theta-k+(k+1)) \\ &= \exp i(\theta-1) \end{aligned}
We also can calculate $T_1(\exp i0) = \exp 179^\circ$ . Thus, the point $(1,0)$ gets sent back to when all double iterations after $1$ cancel $179^\circ$ . $179-\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)=0$ so $n = 1 + 2 \cdot 179 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }359}$ .

## Solution 7 (Matrices)
Similar to the above solution, one can use rotation matrices to compute it.
(i.e. $\begin{bmatrix} cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) \\ sin(\theta) & cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}$ )
For the reflection, use the reflection matrix (i.e. $\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ )
Then proceed like Solution 5.
