## Problem

A data set consists of $6$ (not distinct) positive integers: $1$ , $7$ , $5$ , $2$ , $5$ , and $X$ . The average (arithmetic mean) of the $6$ numbers equals a value in the data set. What is the sum of all positive values of $X$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 10 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 26 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 32 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 36 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 40$

## Solution (Casework)
First, note that $1+7+5+2+5=20$ . There are $3$ possible cases:
Case 1: the mean is .
$X = 5 \cdot 6 - 20 = 10$ .
Case 2: the mean is .
$X = 7 \cdot 6 - 20 = 22$ .
Case 3: the mean is .
$X= \frac{20+X}{6} \Rightarrow X=4$ .
Therefore, the answer is $10+22+4=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }36}$ .
