## Problem

Let $h_n$ and $k_n$ be the unique relatively prime positive integers such that \[\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}=\frac{h_n}{k_n}.\] Let $L_n$ denote the least common multiple of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \ldots, n$ . For how many integers with $1\le{n}\le{22}$ is $k_n<L_n$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }0 \qquad\textbf{(B) }3 \qquad\textbf{(C) }7 \qquad\textbf{(D) }8\qquad\textbf{(E) }10$

## Solution 1
We are given that \[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac1i = \frac{1}{L_n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{L_n}{i} = \frac{h_n}{k_n}.\] Since $k_n < L_n,$ we need $\gcd\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{L_n}{i}, L_n\right)>1.$
For all primes $p$ such that $p\leq n,$ let $\nu_p(L_n)=e\geq1$ be the exponent of the largest power of $p$ that divides $L_n.$
It is clear that $L_n\equiv0\pmod{p},$ so we test whether $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{L_n}{i}\equiv0\pmod{p}.$ Note that \[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{L_n}{i} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{\left\lfloor\tfrac{n}{p^e}\right\rfloor}\frac{L_n}{ip^e} \ (\operatorname{mod} \ p^e) \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{\left\lfloor\tfrac{n}{p^e}\right\rfloor}\frac{L_n}{ip^e} \ (\operatorname{mod} \ p).\] We construct the following table for $\nu_p(L_n)=e:$ \[\begin{array}{c|c|l|c} \textbf{Case of }\boldsymbol{(p,e)} & \textbf{Interval of }\boldsymbol{n} & \hspace{22.75mm}\textbf{Sum} & \boldsymbol{\stackrel{?}{\equiv}0\ (\operatorname{mod} \ p)} \\ [0.5ex] \hline\hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (2,1) & [2,3] & L_n/2 & \\ (2,2) & [4,7] & L_n/4 & \\ (2,3) & [8,15] & L_n/8 & \\ (2,4) & [16,22] & L_n/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (3,1) & [3,5] & L_n/3 & \\ & [6,8] & L_n/3 + L_n/6 & \checkmark \\ (3,2) & [9,17] & L_n/9 & \\ & [18,22] & L_n/9 + L_n/18 & \checkmark \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (5,1) & [5,9] & L_n/5 & \\ & [10,14] & L_n/5 + L_n/10 & \\ & [15,19] & L_n/5 + L_n/10 + L_n/15 & \\ & [20,22] & L_n/5 + L_n/10 + L_n/15 + L_n/20 & \checkmark \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (7,1) & [7,13] & L_n/7 & \\ & [14,20] & L_n/7 + L_n/14 & \\ & [21,22] & L_n/7 + L_n/14 + L_n/21 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (11,1) & [11,21] & L_n/11 & \\ & \{22\} & L_n/11 + L_n/22 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (13,1) & [13,22] & L_n/13 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (17,1) & [17,22] & L_n/17 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] (19,1) & [19,22] & L_n/19 & \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Note that:
1. If the Sum column has only one term, then it is never congruent to $0$ modulo $p.$
1. If $p$ and $q$ are positive integers such that $p\geq q,$ then $L_p$ is a multiple of $L_q.$ Therefore, for a specific case, if the sum is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ for the smallest element in the interval of $n,$ then it is also congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ for all other elements in the interval of $n.$
Together, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$ such integers $n,$ namely \[6,7,8,18,19,20,21,22.\] ~MRENTHUSIASM

## Solution 2
Notice that $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{i} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{L_n}{i}}{L_n}$ . Thus, in order for $L_n$ to reduce to a smaller value, the numerator and denominator must share a common factor.
We can start by testing some values of $n$ , and quickly observe that $n=6$ is the first number that satisfies the desired conditions. In particular, $\sum_{i=1}^{6}\frac{1}{i} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{6}\frac{L_6}{i}}{L_6} = \frac{147}{60} = \frac{49}{20}$ . Since a factor of three is shared, we are motivated to observe factors of three in the numerator $\sum_{i=1}^{6}\frac{60}{i}$ . Notice that $\nu_3(L_6) = 1$ , since $3^1$ is the greatest power of three that occurs in $1,2,3,4,5,6$ . Consider the sum in the numerator in mod 3. We have $(\frac{60}{1}, \frac{60}{2}, \frac{60}{3}, \frac{60}{4}, \frac{60}{5}, \frac{60}{6} )\rightarrow (0,0,2,0,0,1)$ . Adding 0+0+2+0+0+1 we get 0 mod 3, which is why we are able to simplify $\frac{147}{60}$ .
Thus, we should be taking the numerator mod p, where p is a prime.
Quickly, we wish to show that the numerator and denominator can never share a factor of 2. Say we have least common multiple $L_n$ . Let $\nu_2(L_n) = e$ . In other words, let $2^e$ be the largest power of 2 such that $2^e$ divides $L_n$ . Notice that among all numbers $1$ through $n$ , only one of them can be a multiple of $2^e$ , being $2^e$ itself. The next multiple of $2^e$ would be $2 \cdot 2^e = 2^{e+1}$ , contradicting the fact that $\nu_2(L_n) = e$ . This means that in the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{L_n}{i}$ , there will be $1$ value that is $1$ mod $2$ , resulting from $\frac{L_n}{2^e}$ , and the rest are all $0$ s. Clearly, the numerator will then be $1$ mod $2$ , which is not a multiple of 2.
When $p=3$ , $n=6,7,8,18,19,20,21,22$ will all work, and this can be easily tested through taking the numerator mod $3$ . $p=5$ is only satisfied when the $L_n$ contains $(5,10,15,20)$ , so when $n\ge 20$ . However, this is just an overlap with the previous values, so there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$ .

## Video Solution
We will use the following lemma to solve this problem.
Denote by $p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_m^{\alpha_m}$ the prime factorization of $L_n$ . For any $i \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, m \right\}$ , denote $\sum_{j = 1}^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p_i^{\alpha_i}} \right\rfloor} \frac{1}{j} = \frac{a_i}{b_i}$ , where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are relatively prime. Then $k_n = L_n$ if and only if for any $i \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, m \right\}$ , $a_i$ is not a multiple of $p_i$ .
Now, we use the result above to solve this problem.
Following from this lemma, the list of $n$ with $1 \leq n \leq 22$ and $k_n < L_n$ is \[6, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 .\]
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$ .
