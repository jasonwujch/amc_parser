## Problem

How many digits are in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 14 \qquad\textbf{(B) }15 \qquad\textbf{(C) }16 \qquad\textbf{(D) }17 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 18$

## Solution 1
Prime factorizing this gives us $2^{15}\cdot3^{5}\cdot5^{15}=10^{15}\cdot3^5=243\cdot10^{15}$ .
$10^{15}$ has $16$ digits and $243$ = $2.43*10^{2}$ gives us $3$ more digits. $16+2=\text{\boxed{\textbf{(E) }18}}$
$2.43*10^{17}$ has $18$ digits

## Solution 2 (Only if you don't know how to do the rest of the problems and have about 20 minutes left, IT IS recommended)
Multiplying it out, we get that $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5 = 243000000000000000$ . Counting, we have the answer is $\text{\boxed{\textbf{(E) }18}}$ ~andliu766

## Solution 3 (Similar to Solution 1)
All the exponents have a common factor of $5$ which we can factor out. This leaves us with $(8 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 15)^5 = (3000)^5 = (3 \cdot 1000)^5$ . We can then distribute the power leaving us with $3^5 \cdot 10^{3 \cdot 5} = 243 \cdot 10^{15}$ . This would be $243$ followed by $15$ zeros resulting in our answer being $15+3=\text{\boxed{\textbf{(E)}18}}$
