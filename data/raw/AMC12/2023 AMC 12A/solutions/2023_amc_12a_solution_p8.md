# 2023 AMC 12A Problem 8

## Problem

Maureen is keeping track of the mean of her quiz scores this semester. If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her mean will increase by $1$ . If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by $2$ . What is the mean of her quiz scores currently? $\textbf{(A) }4\qquad\textbf{(B) }5\qquad\textbf{(C) }6\qquad\textbf{(D) }7\qquad\textbf{(E) }8$

## Solution 1
Let $a$ represent the amount of tests taken previously and $x$ the mean of the scores taken previously.
We can write the following equations:
\[\frac{ax+11}{a+1}=x+1\qquad (1)\] \[\frac{ax+33}{a+3}=x+2\qquad (2)\]
Multiplying equation $(1)$ by $(a+1)$ and solving, we get: \[ax+11=ax+a+x+1\] \[11=a+x+1\] \[a+x=10\qquad (3)\]
Multiplying equation $(2)$ by $(a+3)$ and solving, we get: \[ax+33=ax+2a+3x+6\] \[33=2a+3x+6\] \[2a+3x=27\qquad (4)\]
Solving the system of equations for $(3)$ and $(4)$ , we find that $a=3$ and $x=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }7}$ .

## Solution 2 (Variation on Solution 1)
Suppose Maureen took $n$ tests with an average of $m$ .
If she takes another test, her new average is $\frac{(nm+11)}{(n+1)}=m+1$
Cross-multiplying: $nm+11=nm+n+m+1$ , so $n+m=10$ .
If she takes $3$ more tests, her new average is $\frac{(nm+33)}{(n+3)}=m+2$
Cross-multiplying: $nm+33=nm+2n+3m+6$ , so $2n+3m=27$ .
But $2n+3m$ can also be written as $2(n+m)+m=20+m$ . Therefore $m=27-20=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }7}$

## Solution 3 (do this if you are bored)
Let $s$ represent the sum of Maureen's test scores previously and $t$ be the number of scores taken previously.
So, $\frac{s+11}{t+1} = \frac{s}{t}+1$ and $\frac{s+33}{t+3} = \frac{s}{t}+2$
We can use the first equation to write $s$ in terms of $t$ .
We then substitute this into the second equation: $\frac{-t^2+10t+33}{t+3} = \frac{-t^2+10t}{t}+2$
From here, we should solve for t: multiply both sides by ( $t$ ) and then ( $t+3$ ), combining like terms to get $t^2-3t=0$ . Factorize to get $t=0$ or $t=3$ , and therefore $t=3$ (makes sense for the problem).
We substitute this to get $s=21$ .
Therefore, the solution to the problem is $\frac{21}{3}=$ $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }7}$

## Solution 4 (Testing Answer Choices)
Let's consider all the answer choices. If the average is $8$ , then, we can assume that all her test choices were $8$ . We can see that she must have gotten $8$ twice, in order for another score of $11$ to bring her average up by one. However, adding three $11$ 's will not bring her score up to 10. Continuing this process for the answer choices, we see that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }7}$ ~andliu766 (minor wording edit by mihikamishra)

## Solution 5
Let $n$ be the number of existing quizzes. So after one more test, score $11$ has $n+1$ extra points to distribute to $n+1$ quizzes. Also, after three more quizzes, there will be $3(n+1)$ extra points to distribute to the $n+3$ quizzes. So $3n+3=2(n+3)$ . This means $n=3$ . $n+1$ extra points means original mean (average) is $7$
