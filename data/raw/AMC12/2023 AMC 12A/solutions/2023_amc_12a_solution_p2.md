## Problem

The weight of $\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of $\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices. A cup of orange slices weighs $\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound. What is the weight, in pounds, of a large pizza?

$\textbf{(A) }1\frac{4}{5}\qquad\textbf{(B) }2\qquad\textbf{(C) }2\frac{2}{5}\qquad\textbf{(D) }3\qquad\textbf{(E) }3\frac{3}{5}$

## Solution 1 (Substitution)
Use a system of equations. Let $x$ be the weight of a pizza and $y$ be the weight of a cup of orange slices. We have \[\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{7}{2}y=\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{1}{2}y.\] Rearranging, we get \begin{align*} \frac{5}{12}x&=3y, \\ x&=\frac{36}{5}y. \end{align*} Plugging in $\frac{1}{4}$ pounds for $y$ by the given gives $\frac{9}{5}=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1\frac{4}{5}}.$

## Solution 2
Let: $p$ be the weight of a pizza. $o$ be the weight of a cup of orange.
From the problem, we know that $o = \frac{1}{4}$ .
Write the equation below: \[\frac{1}{3} p + \frac{7}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} p + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}\]
Solving for $p$ : $\frac{5}{12} p = \frac{3}{4}$
$p = \frac{9}{5} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }1\frac{4}{5}}.$

## Solution 3
$\frac{P}{3} + \frac{7}{2} R = \frac{3}{4} P + \frac{R}{2}$ where $P$ is the pizza weight and $R$ is the weight of cup of oranges Since oranges weigh $\frac{1}{4}$ pound per cup, the oranges on the LHS weigh $\frac{7}{2}$ cups x $\frac{1}{4}$ pounds/cup = $\frac{7}{8}$ pound, and those on the RHS weigh $\frac{1}{2}$ cup x $\frac{1}{4}$ pounds/cup = $\frac{1}{8}$ pound.
So $\frac{P}{3}$ + $\frac{7}{8}$ pound = $\frac{3}{4} P$ + $\frac{1}{8}$ pound; $\frac{P}{3}$ + $\frac{3}{4}$ pound = $\frac{3}{4} P$ .
Multiplying both sides by $\text{lcm}(3,4) = 12$ , we have $4P + 9 = 9P$ ; $5P = 9$ ; $P$ = weight of a large pizza = $\frac{9}{5}$ pounds = $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}1 \frac{4}{5}}$ pounds.
