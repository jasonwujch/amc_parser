# 2023 AMC 12A Problem 6

## Problem

Points $A$ and $B$ lie on the graph of $y=\log_{2}x$ . The midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is $(6, 2)$ . What is the positive difference between the $x$ -coordinates of $A$ and $B$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}~2\sqrt{11}\qquad\textbf{(B)}~4\sqrt{3}\qquad\textbf{(C)}~8\qquad\textbf{(D)}~4\sqrt{5}\qquad\textbf{(E)}~9$

## Solution 1
Let $A(6+m,2+n)$ and $B(6-m,2-n)$ , since $(6,2)$ is their midpoint. Thus, we must find $2m$ . We find two equations due to $A,B$ both lying on the function $y=\log_{2}x$ . The two equations are then $\log_{2}(6+m)=2+n$ and $\log_{2}(6-m)=2-n$ . Now add these two equations to obtain $\log_{2}(6+m)+\log_{2}(6-m)=4$ . By logarithm rules, we get $\log_{2}((6+m)(6-m))=4$ . By raising 2 to the power of both sides, we obtain $(6+m)(6-m)=16$ . We then get \[36-m^2=16 \rightarrow m^2=20 \rightarrow m=2\sqrt{5}\] . Since we're looking for $2m$ , we obtain $(2)(2\sqrt{5})=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4\sqrt{5}}$

## Solution 2
We have $\frac{x_A + x_B}{2} = 6$ and $\frac{\log_2 x_A + \log_2 x_B}{2} = 2$ . The first equation becomes $x_A + x_B = 12,$ and the second becomes $\log_2(x_A x_B) = 4,$ so $x_A x_B = 16.$ Then \begin{align*} \left| x_A - x_B \right| & = \sqrt{\left( x_A + x_B \right)^2 - 4 x_A x_B} \\ & = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 4 \sqrt{5}}. \end{align*}

## Solution 3
Basically, we can use the midpoint formula
assume that the points are $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$
assume that the points are ( $x_1$ , $\log_{2}(x_1)$ ) and ( $x_2$ , $\log_{2}(x_2)$ )
midpoint formula is ( $\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}$ , $\frac{\log_{2}(x_1)+\log_{2}(x_2)}{2}$ )
thus $x_1+x_2=12$ $x_2=12-x_1$ and $\log_{2}(x_1)+\log_{2}(x_2)=4$ $\log_{2}(x_1)+\log_{2}(12-x_1)=\log_{2}(16)$
$\log_{2}((12x_1-x_1^2)/16)=0$
since $2^0=1$ so,
$12x_1-x_1^2=16$
$12x_1-x_1^2-16=0$ for simplicity lets say $x_1 = x$
$12x-x^2=16$ . We rearrange to get $x^2-12x+16=0$ .
put this into quadratic formula and you should get
$x_1=6+2\sqrt{5}$ Therefore, $x_1=6+2\sqrt{5}-(6-2\sqrt{5})$
which equals $6-6+4\sqrt{5}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4\sqrt{5}}$

## Solution 4
Similar to above, but solve for $x = 2^y$ in terms of $y$ :
$(2^{y}+2^{2+(2-y)})/2= 6$
$2^y + 2^{4-y} = 12$
$(2^y)^2 + 2^4 = 12(2^y)$
$x^2 -12x + 16 = 0$
Distance between roots of the quadratic is the discriminant: $\sqrt{{12}^2 - 4(1)(16)} = \sqrt{80} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }4\sqrt{5}}$
