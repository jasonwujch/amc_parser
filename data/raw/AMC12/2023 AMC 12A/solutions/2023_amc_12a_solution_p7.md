# 2023 AMC 12A Problem 7

## Problem

A digital display shows the current date as an $8$ -digit integer consisting of a $4$ -digit year, followed by a $2$ -digit month, followed by a $2$ -digit date within the month. For example, Arbor Day this year is displayed as $20230428.$ For how many dates in $2023$ does each digit appear an even number of times in the $8$ -digital display for that date?

$\textbf{(A)}~5\qquad\textbf{(B)}~6\qquad\textbf{(C)}~7\qquad\textbf{(D)}~8\qquad\textbf{(E)}~9$

## Solution 1 (Casework)
Do careful casework by each month. Make sure to start with 2023. In the month and the date, we need a $0$ , a $3$ , and two digits repeated (which has to be $1$ and $2$ after consideration). After the casework, we get $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~9}$ . For curious readers, the numbers (in chronological order) are:

## Solution 2
There is one $3$ , so we need one more (three more means that either the month or units digit of the day is $3$ ). For the same reason, we need one more $0$ .
If $3$ is the units digit of the month, then the $0$ can be in either of the three remaining slots. For the first case (tens digit of the month), then the last two digits must match ( $11, 22$ ). For the second (tens digit of the day), we must have the other two be $1$ , as a month can't start with $2$ or $0$ . There are $3$ successes this way.
If $3$ is the tens digit of the day, then $0$ can be either the tens digit of the month or the units digit of the day. For the first case, $1$ must go in the other slots. For the second, the other two slots must be $1$ as well. There are $2$ successes here.
If $3$ is the units digit of the day, then $0$ could go in any of the $3$ remaining slots again. If it's the tens digit of the day, then the other digits must be $1$ . If $0$ is the units digit of the day, then the other two slots must both be $1$ . If $0$ is the tens digit of the month, then the other two slots can be either both $1$ or both $2$ . In total, there are $4$ successes here.
Summing through all cases, there are $3 + 2 + 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}~9}$ dates.

## Solution 3
We start with $2023----$ we need an extra $0$ and an extra $3$ . So we have at least one of those extras in the days, except we can have the month $03$ . We now have $6$ possible months $01,02,03,10,11,12$ . For month $1$ we have two cases, we now have to add in another 1, and the possible days are $13,31$ . For month $2$ we need an extra $2$ so we can have the day $23$ note that we can't use $32$ because it is to large. Now for month $3$ we can have any number and multiply it by $11$ so we have the solution $11,22$ . For October we need a $1$ and a $3$ so we have $13,31$ as our choices. For November we have two choices which are $03,30$ .Now for December we have $0$ options. Summing $2+1+2+2+2$ we get $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~9}$ solutions.
