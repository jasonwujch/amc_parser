## Problem

A coin is altered so that the probability that it lands on heads is less than $\frac{1}{2}$ and when the coin is flipped four times, the probability of an equal number of heads and tails is $\frac{1}{6}$ . What is the probability that the coin lands on heads?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{\sqrt{15}-3}{6} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{6-\sqrt{6\sqrt{6}+2}}{12} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{2} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{3-\sqrt{3}}{6} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2}$

## Solution
Let $x$ be the probability of flipping heads. It follows that the probability of flipping tails is $1-x$ .
The probability of flipping $2$ heads and $2$ tails is equal to the number of ways to flip it times the product of the probability of flipping each coin.
\begin{align*}{4 \choose 2}x^2(1-x)^2 &= \frac{1}{6}\\ 6x^2(1-x)^2 &= \frac{1}{6}\\ x^2(1-x)^2 &= \frac{1}{36}\\ x(1-x) &= \pm\frac{1}{6}\end{align*}
As for the desired probability $x$ both $x$ and $1-x$ are nonnegative, we only need to consider the positive root, hence
\begin{align*}x(1-x) &= \frac{1}{6}\\ 6x^2-6x+1&=0\end{align*}
Applying the quadratic formula we get that the roots of this equation are $\frac{3\pm\sqrt{3}}{6}$ . As the probability of heads is less than $\frac{1}{2}$ , we get that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{3-\sqrt{3}}{6}}$ .
