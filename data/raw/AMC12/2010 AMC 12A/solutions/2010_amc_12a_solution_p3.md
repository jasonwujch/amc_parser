# 2010 AMC 12A Problem 3

## Problem

Rectangle $ABCD$ , pictured below, shares $50\%$ of its area with square $EFGH$ . Square $EFGH$ shares $20\%$ of its area with rectangle $ABCD$ . What is $\frac{AB}{AD}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 6 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 10$

## Solution 1
If we shift $A$ to coincide with $E$ , and add new horizontal lines to divide $EFGH$ into five equal parts:
This helps us to see that $AD=a/5$ and $AB=2a$ , where $a=EF$ . Hence $\dfrac{AB}{AD}=\dfrac{2a}{a/5}=10$ .

## Solution 2
From the problem statement, we know that \[\frac{[ABCD]}{2} = \frac{[EFGH]}{5} \Rightarrow [ABCD]=\frac{2[EFGH]}{5}\]
If we let $a = EF$ and $b = AD$ , we see \[[ABCD] = 2ab = \frac{2a^2}{5} \Rightarrow b = \frac{a}{5}\] . Hence, $\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{2a}{b} = 2a(\frac{5}{a}) = \boxed{\bold{10}}$
