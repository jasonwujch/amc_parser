# 2010 AMC 12A Problem 5

## Problem

Halfway through a 100-shot archery tournament, Chelsea leads by 50 points. For each shot a bullseye scores 10 points, with other possible scores being 8, 4, 2, and 0 points. Chelsea always scores at least 4 points on each shot. If Chelsea's next $n$ shots are bullseyes she will be guaranteed victory. What is the minimum value for $n$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 38 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 40 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 42 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 44 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 46$

## Solution
Let $k$ be the number of points Chelsea currently has. In order to guarantee victory, we must consider the possibility that the opponent scores the maximum amount of points by getting only bullseyes.
\begin{align*}k+ 10n + 4(50-n) &> (k-50) + 50\cdot{10}\\ 6n &> 250\end{align*}
The lowest integer value that satisfies the inequality is $\boxed{42\ \textbf{(C)}}$ .
