# 2010 AMC 12A Problem 7

## Problem

Logan is constructing a scaled model of his town. The city's water tower stands 40 meters high, and the top portion is a sphere that holds 100,000 liters of water. Logan's miniature water tower holds 0.1 liters. How tall, in meters, should Logan make his tower?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0.04 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{0.4}{\pi} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 0.4 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{4}{\pi} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 4$

## Solution
The water tower holds $\frac{100000}{0.1} = 1000000$ times more water than Logan's miniature. The volume of a sphere is: $V=\dfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ . Since we are comparing the heights (m), we should compare the radii (m) to find the ratio. Since, the radius is cubed, Logan should make his tower $\sqrt[3]{1000000} = 100$ times shorter than the actual tower. This is $\frac{40}{100} = \boxed{0.4}$ meters high, or choice $\textbf{(C)}$ .
Note: The fact that $1\text{ L}=1000\text{ cm}^3$ doesn't matter since only the ratios are important.
