# 2010 AMC 12A Problem 6

## Problem

A $\text{palindrome}$ , such as $83438$ , is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. The numbers $x$ and $x+32$ are three-digit and four-digit palindromes, respectively. What is the sum of the digits of $x$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 20 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 21 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 22 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 23 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 24$

## Solution

## Solution 1
$x$ is at most $999$ , so $x+32$ is at most $1031$ . The minimum value of $x+32$ is $1000$ . However, the only palindrome between $1000$ and $1032$ is $1001$ , which means that $x+32$ must be $1001$ .
It follows that $x$ is $969$ , so the sum of the digits is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 24}$ .

## Solution 2
For $x+32$ to be a four-digit number, $x$ is in between $968$ and $999$ . The palindromes in this range are $969$ , $979$ , $989$ , and $999$ , so the sum of the digits of $x$ can be $24$ , $25$ , $26$ , or $27$ . Only $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 24}$ is an option, and upon checking, $x+32=1001$ is indeed a palindrome.

## Solution 3
Since we know $x+32$ to be $1 a a 1$ and the only palindrome that works is $0 = a$ , that means $x+32 = 1001$ , and so $x = 1001 - 32 = 969$ . So, $9$ + $6$ + $9$ = $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 24}$ . ~songmath20
