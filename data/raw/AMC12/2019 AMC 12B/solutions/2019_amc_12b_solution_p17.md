## Problem

How many nonzero complex numbers $z$ have the property that $0, z,$ and $z^3,$ when represented by points in the complex plane, are the three distinct vertices of an equilateral triangle?

$\textbf{(A) }0\qquad\textbf{(B) }1\qquad\textbf{(C) }2\qquad\textbf{(D) }4\qquad\textbf{(E) }\text{infinitely many}$

## Solution 1
Convert $z$ and $z^3$ into modulus-argument (polar) form, giving $z=r\text{cis}(\theta)$ for some $r$ and $\theta$ . Thus, by De Moivre's Theorem, $z^3=r^3\text{cis}(3\theta)$ . Since the distance from $0$ to $z$ is $r$ , and the triangle is equilateral, the distance from $0$ to $z^3$ must also be $r$ , so $r^3=r$ , giving $r=1$ . (We know $r \neq 0$ since the problem statement specifies that $z$ must be nonzero.)
Now, to get from $z$ to $z^3$ , which should be a rotation of $60^{\circ}$ if the triangle is equilateral, we multiply by $z^2 = \text{cis}(2\theta)$ , again using De Moivre's Theorem and $r=1$ . Thus we require $2\theta=\pm\frac{\pi}{3} + 2\pi k$ (where $k$ can be any integer). If $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$ , we must have $\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}$ , while if $\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta < \pi$ , we must have $\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}$ . Hence there are $2$ values that work for $0 < \theta < \pi$ . By symmetry, the interval $\pi \leq \theta < 2\pi$ will also give $2$ solutions. The answer is thus $2 + 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$ .

## Solution 2 (Quick Look)
As before, $r=1$ . Represent $z$ in polar form. By De Moivre's Theorem, $z^3=\text{cis}(3\theta)$ . To form an equilateral triangle, their difference in angle must be $\frac{\pi}{3}$ , so \[\frac{\text{cis}(3\theta)}{\text{cis}(\theta)}=\text{cis}(2\theta)=\text{cis}(\pm\frac{\pi}{3})\] From the polar form of $z$ , we know that $0\geq\theta\leq2\pi$ , so $\text{cis}(2\theta)$ cycles in a circle twice. By contrast, $\pm\frac{\pi}{3}$ represent $2$ fixed, distinct points. Thus, $\text{cis}(2\theta)$ intersects these points twice each $\implies\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$

## Solution 3
For the triangle to be equilateral, the vector from $z$ to $z^3$ , i.e $z^3 - z$ , must be a $60^{\circ}$ rotation of the vector from $0$ to $z$ , i.e. just $z$ . Thus we must have
\[\frac{(z^3-z)}{(z-0)}=\text{cis}{(\pi/3)} \text{ or } \text{cis}(5\pi/3)\]
Simplifying gives \[z^2-1= \text{cis}(\pi/3) \text{ or } z^2-1= \text{cis}(5\pi/3)\] so \[z^2=1+\text{cis}(\pi/3) \text{ or } z^2=1+\text{cis}(5\pi/3)\]
Since any nonzero complex number will have two square roots, each equation gives two solutions. Thus, as before, the total number of possible values of $z$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$ .

## Solution 4 (Quick and Easy)
Since the complex numbers $0,z,$ and $z^3$ form an equilateral triangle in the complex plane, we note that either $z^3$ is a 60 degrees counterclockwise rotation about the origin from $z$ or $z$ is a 60 degrees counterclockwise rotation about the origin from $z^3$ .
Therefore, we note that either $z^3 = z \text{cis} 60^\circ{}$ or $z \text{cis}(-60^\circ{}) = z^3$
The first equation in $z$ (meaning $z^3 = z \text{cis} 60^\circ{}$ ) gives us: $z^2 = cis 60^\circ{}$ , which gives 2 solutions in $z$ .
The second equation in $z$ (which is $z \text{cis} (-60^\circ{}) = z^3$ ) gives us $z^2 = \text{cis} (-60^\circ{})$ , which must give another 2 solutions in $z$ .
Therefore, there are $\boxed{(D) 4}$ solutions for $z$ . (Professor-Mom)
Note: The motivation for this method came from an older AIME problem, namely https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1994_AIME_Problems/Problem_8 .

## Solution 5
Let the $z = re^{i\theta}$ , so $z^3 = r^3e^{3i\theta}$ . To have an equilateral triangle, we must have $|z^3| = |z|$ , so $r^3 = r$ , so $r= 1$ .
Note that the angle between $z^3$ and $z$ is $3\theta - \theta = 2\theta$ . Then, by the Law of Cosines,
\[|z^3 - z|^2 = |z|^2 + |z^3|^2 - 2|z||z^3|\cos 2\theta.\]
Since we have an equilateral triangle, it must be that $|z^3 - z| =|z| = |z^3| = r = 1$ . Hence, \[1 = 2 - 2\cos 2\theta = 2 - 2(1-2\sin^2\theta) = 4\sin^2\theta,\] \[\sin^2\theta = \frac{1}{4}\] \[\sin\theta = \pm\frac{1}{2}\] \[\theta = \pm\frac{\pi}{6}, \pm\frac{5\pi}{6}.\]
These $4$ values of $\theta$ correspond to $\boxed{(D)4}$ distinct values of $z$ . ~ brainfertilzer

## Solution 6 (Quick, rectangular form)
Let $z = a + bi$ , where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then, since 0, $z$ , and $z^3$ are vertices of an equilateral triangle in the complex plane, expanding $z^3$ gives the following : \[(a + bi)^3 = (a^3 - 3ab^2) + i(3a^2b - b^3)\] Now, we let $z = z^3$ and equate real and complex parts. It then follows that : \[a^3 - 3ab^2 = a, 3a^2b - b^3 = b\] from which solving gives \[a^2 - 3b^2 = 1 (1), 3a^2 - b^2 = 1 (2)\] We find (1) = (2) \[a^2 - 3b^2 = 3a^2 - b^2\] and \[a^2 = -b^2\] Focusing on (1) then gives \[4a^2 = 1\] \[a^2 = \frac{1}{4}\] Now, finding the square roots gives \[a = \pm\frac{1}{2}, b = \pm\frac{i}{2}\] And so there are $\boxed{(D)4}$ possible solutions. ~elpianista227
