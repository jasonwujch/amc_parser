## Problem

Alicia had two containers. The first was $\tfrac{5}{6}$ full of water and the second was empty. She poured all the water from the first container into the second container, at which point the second container was $\tfrac{3}{4}$ full of water. What is the ratio of the volume of the first container to the volume of the second container?

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{5}{8} \qquad \textbf{(B) } \frac{4}{5} \qquad \textbf{(C) } \frac{7}{8} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{9}{10} \qquad \textbf{(E) } \frac{11}{12}$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Let the first jar's volume be $A$ and the second's be $B$ . It is given that $\frac{5}{6}A=\frac{3}{4}B$ . We find that $\frac{A}{B}=\frac{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)}{\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{9}{10}}.$
We already know that this is the ratio of the smaller to the larger volume because it is less than $1.$

## Solution 2
An alternate solution is to substitute an arbitrary maximum volume for the first container - let's say $72$ , so there was a volume of $60$ in the first container, and then the second container also has a volume of $60$ , so you get $60 \cdot \frac{4}{3} = 80$ . Thus the answer is $\frac{72}{80} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{9}{10}}$ .
