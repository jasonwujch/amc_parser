## Problem

Each piece of candy in a store costs a whole number of cents. Casper has exactly enough money to buy either $12$ pieces of red candy, $14$ pieces of green candy, $15$ pieces of blue candy, or $n$ pieces of purple candy. A piece of purple candy costs $20$ cents. What is the smallest possible value of $n$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 18 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 21 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 24\qquad \textbf{(D) } 25 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 28$

## Solution 1
If he has enough money to buy $12$ pieces of red candy, $14$ pieces of green candy, and $15$ pieces of blue candy, then the smallest amount of money he could have is $\text{lcm}{(12,14,15)} = 420$ cents. Since a piece of purple candy costs $20$ cents, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\frac{420}{20} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 21}$ .

## Solution 2
We simply need to find a value of $20n$ that is divisible by $12$ , $14$ , and $15$ . Observe that $20 \cdot 18$ is divisible by $12$ and $15$ , but not $14$ . $20 \cdot 21$ is divisible by $12$ , $14$ , and $15$ , meaning that we have exact change (in this case, $420$ cents) to buy each type of candy, so the minimum value of $n$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 21}$ .

## Solution 3
We can notice that the number of purple candy times $20$ has to be divisible by $7$ , because of the $14$ green candies, and $3$ , because of the $12$ red candies. $7\cdot3=21$ , so the answer has to be $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 21}$ .
