## Problem

For how many integral values of $x$ can a triangle of positive area be formed having side lengths $\log_{2} x, \log_{4} x, 3$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 57 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 59 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 61 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 62 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 63$

## Solution
For these lengths to form a triangle of positive area, the Triangle Inequality tells us that we need \[\log_2{x} + \log_4{x} > 3\] \[\log_2{x} + 3 > \log_4{x}\] \[\log_4{x} + 3 > \log_2{x}.\] The second inequality is redundant, as it's always less restrictive than the last inequality.
Let's raise the first inequality to the power of $4$ . This gives $4^{\log_2{x}} \cdot 4^{\log_4{x}} > 64 \Rightarrow \left(2^2\right)^{\log_2{x}} \cdot x > 64 \Rightarrow x^2 \cdot x > 64$ . Thus, $x > 4$ .
Doing the same for the third inequality gives $4^{\log_4{x}} \cdot 64 > 4^{\log_2{x}} \Rightarrow 64x > x^2 \Rightarrow x < 64$ (where we are allowed to divide both sides by $x$ since $x$ must be positive in order for the logarithms given in the problem statement to even have real values).
Combining our results, $x$ is an integer strictly between $4$ and $64$ , so the number of possible values of $x$ is $64 - 4 - 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 59}$ .

## Solution 2 (Somewhat Cheating)
Using the triangle inequality, you get $\log_2{x}+\log_4{x} > 3$ . Solving for $x$ , you get $x > 4$ . Now we need an upper-bound for $x$ and since we're dealing with bases of $2$ and $4$ , we're looking for answer choices close to a power of $2$ and $4$ . All the answer choices seem to be around $64$ , and plugging that into the inequality $3+\log_4{x} > \log_2{x}$ we see $64$ is the correct number. Now we have $64 > x > 4$ and the number of integers in between is $64-4-1 = \boxed{{59 \textbf{(B)}}}$ --OGBooger
