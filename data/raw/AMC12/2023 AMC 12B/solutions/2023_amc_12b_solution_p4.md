## Problem

Jackson's paintbrush makes a narrow strip with a width of $6.5$ millimeters. Jackson has enough paint to make a strip $25$ meters long. How many square centimeters of paper could Jackson cover with paint?

$\textbf{(A) } 162,500 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 162.5 \qquad\textbf{(C) }1,625 \qquad\textbf{(D) }1,625,000 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 16,250$

## Solution 1
$6.5$ millimeters is equal to $0.65$ centimeters. $25$ meters is $2500$ centimeters. The answer is $0.65 \times 2500$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) 1,625}}$ .

## Solution 2 (Scientific Form)
$6.5$ millimeters can be represented as $65 \times 10^{-2}$ centimeters. $25$ meters is $25 \times 10^{2}$ centimeters. Multiplying out these results in $(65 \times 10^{-2}) \times (25 \times 10^{2})$ , which is $65 \times 25$ making the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(C) 1,625}}$ .

### Remark
A good way to remember metric conversions is with the phrase "King Henry Died By Drinking Chocolate Milk" (Kilo, Hecto, Deka, Basic units, Deci, Centi, Milli). As you read from left to right you divide by 10. So 1 meter (which is a basic unit) is equivalent to $1000$ millimeters, or $100$ centimeters.
