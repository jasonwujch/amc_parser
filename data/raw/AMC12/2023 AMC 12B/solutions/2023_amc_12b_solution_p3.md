## Problem

A $3-4-5$ right triangle is inscribed in circle $A$ , and a $5-12-13$ right triangle is inscribed in circle $B$ . What is the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }\frac{9}{25}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{9}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{1}{5}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\frac{25}{169}\qquad\textbf{(E) }\frac{4}{25}$

## Solution 1
Because the triangles are right triangles, we know the hypotenuses are diameters of circles $A$ and $B$ . Thus, their radii are 2.5 and 6.5 (respectively). Square the two numbers and multiply $\pi$ to get $6.25\pi$ and $42.25\pi$ as the areas of the circles. Multiply 4 on both numbers to get $25\pi$ and $169\pi$ . Cancel out the $\pi$ , and lastly, divide, to get your answer $=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{25}{169}}.$

## Solution 1.5 (Way FASTER! Use in the contest)
With right triangles inscribed in circles, the hypotenuse must be the diameter. Therefore, the ratio of radii is $\frac{5}{13}$ which means the area ratio is just $\frac{5^2}{13^2}$ so, $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{25}{169}}.$

## Note for Solution 1
The reason why the right triangle has its hypotenuse on the diameter is because of its properties with the circle and the central angle theorem. The central angle theorem states that an angle inscribed on a circle is just arc length in degrees. The diameter of a circle splits the circle into two halves with arc of \( 180^\circ \), and therefore the angle inscribed in that arc is just \( 180/2 = 90 \) degrees. The longest side of a triangle is opposite to the longest angle, and therefore the length of the hypotenuse is just the diameter of the circle.

## Solution 2
Since the arc angle of the diameter of a circle is $90$ degrees, the hypotenuse of each these two triangles is respectively the diameter of circles $A$ and $B$ .
Therefore the ratio of the areas equals the radius of circle $A$ squared : the radius of circle $B$ squared $=$ $0.5\times$ the diameter of circle $A$ , squared : $0.5\times$ the diameter of circle $B$ , squared $=$ the diameter of circle $A$ , squared: the diameter of circle $B$ , squared $=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{25}{169}}.$

## Solution 3
The ratio of areas of circles is the same as the ratios of the diameters squared (since they are similar figures). Since this is a right triangle the hypotenuse of each triangle will be the diameter of the circle. This yields the expression $\frac{5^2}{13^2} =\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{25}{169}}.$
