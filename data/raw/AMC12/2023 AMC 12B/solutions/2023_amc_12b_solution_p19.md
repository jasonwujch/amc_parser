# 2023 AMC 12B Problem 19

## Problem

Each of $2023$ balls is randomly placed into one of $3$ bins. Which of the following is closest to the probability that each of the bins will contain an odd number of balls?

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{2}{3} \qquad\textbf{(B) } \frac{3}{10} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{2} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \frac{1}{3} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \frac{1}{4}$

## Note Regarding Solutions
Some of the solutions below are not quite correct, though they ultimately lead to the same answer choice. See the Talk page for more details .

## Solution 1
Because each bin will have an odd number, they will have at least one ball. So we can put one ball in each bin prematurely. We then can add groups of 2 balls into each bin, meaning we now just have to spread 1010 pairs over 3 bins. This will force every bin to have an odd number of balls. Using stars and bars, we find that this is equal to $\binom{1012}{2}$ . This is equal to $\frac{1012\cdot1011}{2}$ . The total amount of ways would also be found using stars and bars. That would be $\binom{2023+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{2025}{2}$ . Dividing our two quantities, we get $\frac{1012 \cdot 1011 \cdot 2}{2 \cdot 2025 \cdot 2024}$ . We can roughly cancel $\frac{1012 \cdot 1011}{2025 \cdot 2024}$ to get $\frac{1}{4}$ . The 2 in the numerator and denominator also cancels out, so we're left with $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$ .
Note: My solution does not provide an exact probability, but is a good estimate, which is how this problem was designed. Most of the solutions on this page will give a decent estimate. This is due to the fact that the binomial expansions are symmetric for even vs odd. Try experimenting to determine why this is true.

## Solution 2 (Systematic Algebraic Way)
Suppose the numbers are $a_1$ , $a_2$ , and $a_3$ . First, we try to calculate the amount of ways for all three balls to be placed in a bin so the number of balls in each bin is odd. $a_1+a_2+a_3=2023$ and each bin has at least one ball because they are positive odd numbers. Changing the equation, we see that $\frac{[(a_1)+1]}{2}+\frac{[(a_2)+1]}{2}+\frac{[(a_3)+1]}{2}=\frac{(2023+3)}{2}$ . Let $a_1+1=2b_1$ , $a_2+1=2b_2$ , and $a_3+1=2b_3$ . Thus $b_1+b_2+b_3=1013$ . We can also see that $b_1$ , $b_2$ , and $b_3$ are all positive. Using the positive version of stars and bars, we get ${1013-1 \choose 3-1}$ = ${1012 \choose 2}$ choices.
Now, we want to find the total amount of cases. Using the non-negative version of stars and bars, we find that the total is ${2023+3-1 \choose 3-1}$ = ${2025 \choose 2}$ .
Now we need to calculate ${1012 \choose 2}$ / ${2025 \choose 2}$ , which is just $\frac{1012 \cdot 1011 \cdot 2}{2 \cdot 2025 \cdot 2024}$ . Cancelling the twos, we get $\frac{1012 \cdot 1011}{2025 \cdot 2024}$ . This is roughly equal to $\frac{1}{4}$ . The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \frac{1}{4}}$ .

## Solution 3 (Pairing)
There are \( \left\lceil\frac{2023}{2}\right\rceil = 1012 \) odd numbers between 1 and 2023.
Out of these, there are \( \left\lfloor\frac{1012}{3}\right\rfloor = 337 \) ways to evenly distribute each ball into the first bin, then, WLOG, we say there is \( 337 - 2 = 335 \) for the second and \( 337 + 2 = 339 \) for the third bin.
Out of these, there are \( \left\lfloor\frac{337}{2}\right\rfloor = 168 \) odd sums of pairs for the first bin, then \( \left\lfloor\frac{335}{2}\right\rfloor = 167 \) for the second, and \( \left\lfloor\frac{339}{2}\right\rfloor = 169 \) for the third. The sum of all of these is \( 168 + 167 + 169 = 504 \) total distributions.
From here, we need to find the probability over 2023 total distributed balls, which is simply \( 504/2023 \approx 500/2000 = 1/4 \Rightarrow \) $\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \frac{1}{4}}$ .
This is not an exact probability. It is simply a solution for general competition math. For the exact way to calculate the probability (highly not recommended), please refer to Solution 8.

## Solution 4
We first examine the possible arrangements for parity of number of balls in each box for $2022$ balls.
If a $E$ denotes an even number and a $O$ denotes an odd number, then the distribution of balls for $2022$ balls could be $EEE,EOO,OEO,$ or $OOE$ . With the insanely overpowered magic of cheese, we assume that each case is about equally likely.
From $EEE$ , it is not possible to get to all odd by adding one ball; we could either get $OEE,EOE,$ or $EEO$ . For the other $3$ cases, though, if we add a ball to the exact right place, then it'll work.
For each of the working cases, we have $1$ possible slot the ball can go into (for $OEO$ , for example, the new ball must go in the center slot to make $OOO$ ) out of the $3$ slots, so there's a $\dfrac13$ chance. We have a $\dfrac34$ chance of getting one of these working cases, so our answer is $\dfrac34\cdot\dfrac13=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\dfrac14.}$

## Solution 5
2023 is an arbitrary large number. So, we proceed assuming that an arbitrarily large number of balls have been placed.
For an odd-numbered amount of balls case, the 3 bins can only be one of these 2 combinations:
$OEE$ ( $OEE$ , $EOE$ , $EEO$ )
$OOO$ ( $OOO$ )
Let the probability of achieving the $OOO$ case to be $P(OOO) = p$ and any of the $OEE$ permutations to be $P(OEE) = 1-p$ .
Because the amount of balls is arbitrarily large, $P(OOO) = p$ even after another two balls are be placed.
There are two cases for which placing another two balls results in $OOO$ :
$OOO$ : The two balls are placed in the same bin ( $OOO\to OOE\to OOO$ )
$OEE$ : The two balls are placed in the two even bins ( $OEE\to OOE \to OOO$ )
So,
$P(OOO) = P(OOO) * \frac{1}{3} + P(OEE) * \frac{2}{3} * \frac{1}{3}$
$p = p * \frac{1}{3} + (1-p) * \frac{2}{3} * \frac{1}{3}$
$\frac{8}{9}p = \frac{2}{9}$
$p = \boxed {\textbf {(E)} \frac {1}{4}}$

## Solution 6
We use the generating functions approach to solve this problem. Define $\Delta = \left\{ \left( a, b, c \right) \in \Bbb Z_+: a+b+c = 2023 \right\}$ .
We have \[ \left( x + y + z \right)^{2023} = \sum_{(a,b,c) \in \Delta} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} x^a y^b z^c . \]
First, we set $x \leftarrow 1$ , $y \leftarrow 1$ , $z \leftarrow 1$ . We get \[ 3^{2023} = \sum_{(a,b,c) \in \Delta} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} 1 . \hspace{1cm} (1) \]
Second, we set $x \leftarrow 1$ , $y \leftarrow -1$ , $z \leftarrow 1$ . We get \[ 1 = \sum_{(a,b,c) \in \Delta} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} (-1)^b . \hspace{1cm} (2) \]
Third, we set $x \leftarrow 1$ , $y \leftarrow 1$ , $z \leftarrow -1$ . We get \[ 1 = \sum_{(a,b,c) \in \Delta} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} (-1)^c . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Fourth, we set $x \leftarrow 1$ , $y \leftarrow -1$ , $z \leftarrow -1$ . We get \[ -1 = \sum_{(a,b,c) \in \Delta} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} (-1)^{b+c} . \hspace{1cm} (4) \]
Taking $\frac{(1)-(2) - (3)+(4)}{4}$ , we get \begin{align*} \frac{3^{2023} - 1 - 1 + (-1)}{4} & = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{(a,b,c) \in \Delta} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} \left( 1 - (-1)^b - (-1)^c + (-1)^{b+c} \right) \\ & = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{(a,b,c) \in \Delta} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} \left( 1 - (-1)^b \right) \left( 1 - (-1)^c \right) \\ & = \sum_{\substack{(a,b,c) \in \Delta \\ a, b, c \mbox{ are odds}}} \binom{2023}{a,b,c} . \end{align*}
The last expression above is the number of ways to get all three bins with odd numbers of balls. Therefore, this happens with probability \begin{align*} \frac{\frac{3^{2023} - 1 - 1 + (-1)}{4}}{3^{2023}} & \approx \boxed{\textbf{(E) } \frac{1}{4}}. \end{align*}

## Solution 7
Four even-odd splittings divides $2023$ in to three, namely $(O,O,O)$ , $(E,E,O)$ , $(E,O,E)$ , and $(O,E,E)$ . Here if we define a "move" as relocated one ball, then we will notice in each case, that a random "move" will be evenly likely to be one of the other three splittings. Hence by Group theory (or by intuition), we will find the structure of this splitting is $V_4$ group, and it's symmetric for all four elements in this Group.
Thus, no matter what is the initial starting point, four cases will be evenly likely to appear when repeated many times. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \frac{1}{4}}$ .

## Solution 8 (Exact Probability)
Let $p(n)$ be the probability of all 3 bins having odd number of balls when we randomly put $2n+1$ balls into these bins. We need find out $p(1011)$ . Clearly $p(0)=0$ . For $n>1$ , there are only two scenarios for the first $2n-1$ balls: Case 1 all 3 bins are odd; Case 2 only 1 bin is odd and the other 2 bins are even.
For case 1 which has a probability $p(n-1)$ , in order to get all 3 bins to be odd, we need to put the last 2 balls in the same bin. This has a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ .
For case 2 which has a probability of $1-p(n-1)$ , in order to get all 3 bins to be odd, we need to put the last 2 balls into the 2 even bins. The first one has a probability of $\frac{2}{3}$ to be put in an even bin, and the second has a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ to be put the in the last even bin, so the probability is $\frac{2}{9}$ to get all 3 bins to be odd in this case.
So we have $p(n)=\frac{1}{3} p(n-1) + \frac{2}{9} (1-p(n-1)) = \frac{1}{9} p(n-1) + \frac{2}{9}$ .
Solving for the fixed point: $x=\frac{1}{9} x + \frac{2}{9}$ yields $x=\frac{1}{4}$ , and this helps us the rewrite the above as $p(n) - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{9} (p(n-1) - \frac{1}{4} )$ .
Therefore $p(n)-\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{9^n} (p(0) - \frac{1}{4})$ . Using $p(0)=0$ , we have $p(n)=\frac{1}{4} (1 - \frac{1}{9^n})$ .
The probability for 2023 balls is $\frac{1}{4} (1 - \frac{1}{9^{1011}})$ , and this is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \frac{1}{4}}$ .

## Solution 9 (Recursion, rigorous)
We can use recursion to figure out an expression that determines the probability of all the bins being odd.
Define $P_n$ to be the probability that with $2n-1$ balls, randomly inserting them makes all 3 bins have an odd count. We would first want to find $P_{n+1}=f(P_n)$ for some function $f$ .
Now, we can say that if we have an O-O-O combination, where O denotes odd and E denotes even, then to add 2 more balls to keep it O-O-O, we need to put them in the same bin. This would result in a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability of staying O-O-O.
If we have an E-E-O combination, then we need to add 2 more balls, one in each of the even bins. This would result in a $\frac{2}{9}$ probability of turning to O-O-O. Now, we can write a function of $P_{n+1}$ in terms of $P_n$ .
$P_{n+1}=\frac{1}{3}P_n+\frac{2}{9}-\frac{2}{9}P_n=\frac{1}{9}P_n+\frac{2}{9}$
Now, we want to express $P_{n+1}=g(n)$ for some function $g$ . Here, the $\frac{2}{9}$ is a problem because now we can't just put it as a geometric sequence. However, we can rewrite it as followed:
$P_{n+1}=\frac{1}{9}P_n+\frac{2}{9}$
$P_{n+1}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{9}(P_n-\frac{1}{4})$
Now, we can let $Q_n=P_n-\frac{1}{4}$ . We can rewrite that as $Q_{n+1}=\frac{1}{9}Q_n$ .
We can note that $Q_1=P_1-\frac{1}{4}$ . Since $P_1=0$ (you only have one ball, so two of the bins have to be even), $Q_1=-\frac{1}{4}$ . Therefore, $Q_n=Q_1(\frac{1}{9})^{n-1}=-\frac{1}{4} \cdot (\frac{1}{9})^{n-1}$ .
Substituting, we can find that $P_n=-\frac{1}{4} \cdot (\frac{1}{9})^{n-1}+\frac{1}{4}$ .
2023 is the 1012th odd number, so we can substitute $n=1012$ into the equation.
$-\frac{1}{4} \cdot (\frac{1}{9})^{1011}+\frac{1}{4} \approx 0+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{4}$ .
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\frac{1}{4}}$

## Solution 10 (Generating Functions instead of stars and bars)
Define \begin{align*} [x^{2023}]G(x)&=(x^1 + x^3 + ... + x^{2023} + ...)^3 \\ [x^{2023}]G(x)&= x^3(1+x^2+x^4+...+x^{2022}+...)^3 \\ [x^{2020}]G(x)&= (\frac{1}{1-x^2})^3 \\ [x^{2020}]G(x)&= (1-x^2)^{-3} \\ [x^{2020}]G(x)&= (1 + \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2 \cdot 1}(x^2)^1 + ... \frac{1012 \cdot 1011}{2 \cdot 1}(x^2)^{1010}) \\ [x^{2020}] &= \frac{1012 \cdot 1011}{2 \cdot 1} \end{align*}
Similarly we can compute the total number of cases which is: $\frac{2025\cdot 2022}{2 \cdot 1}$
So, the probability is: \begin{align*} &= \frac {\frac{1012 \cdot 1011}{2 \cdot 1}}{\frac{2025\cdot 2024}{2 \cdot 1}} \\ &= \frac{1012 \cdot 1011}{2025 \cdot 2024} \\ &\approx \frac{1}{4} \\ \end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\frac{1}{4}}$

## Solution 11 (Short On Time)
One must not forget that the balls are placed randomly. With intuition, we can assume that the probability of getting $OOO$ , $OOE$ , $OEE$ , and $EEE$ , where $O$ denotes odd numbers and $E$ denotes even numbers, would nearly be the same. Since there are $4$ possible outcomes and $1$ of them is desired, we can conclude that the likelihood of getting $OOO$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ and that the correct answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\frac{1}{4}}$ .
Note: Use this type of reasoning only when a logical solution doesn't work out for you.
~Aqf243
Another Note (not by Aqf243): This may not be the best solution because 2023 is an odd number. Hence, realistically, the probability of getting $OOE$ is 0, allowing us to remove it from our list. This is because adding 2 odd numbers (represented as 2 numbers $x \in \{ x \mid x \bmod 2 = 1 \}$ ) always results in an even number.
$\because \newline$ $x_1=1\mod{2}$
$x_2=1\mod{2}$
$\therefore \\ x_1+x_2=1+1 \mod{2}=2 \mod{2}= 0 \mod{2}$
for any number $x\in{{}x\mid x\mod{2}=0{}}$ , $x$ is an even number.
Similarly, adding two even numbers creates another even number
$x_1=0 \mod{2} \\ x_2=0 \mod{2}$ $x_1+x_2=0+0 \mod{2}=0 \mod{2}$
So adding 2 odd numbers an an even number ALWAYS results in an even number.
Basically, Aqf243 got a little lucky in this situation...

## Solution 12 (Notice a pattern)
Let the bins be called $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . We want the number of odd positive integer solutions that satisfy $a + b + c = 2023$ . We know from stars and bars that the total number of integer solutions is $\binom{2023 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{2025}{2}$ . If $a = 1$ , $b$ can be any odd number from $1$ to $2021$ . There are $(2021 + 1)/2 = 1011$ choices for $b$ . If $a = 3$ , there would be $1010$ choices for $b$ , and so on. $c$ is always constrained by $a$ and $b$ so our answer is just the number of choices $b$ has for each $a$ , which is the sum of all integers from $1$ to $1011 = \frac{1011 \cdot 1012}{2}$ . So we get $\frac{1011 \cdot 1012/2}{\binom{2025}{2}}$ (around $0.249$ ), which is closest to $0.25$ or $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\frac{1}{4}}$ .
NOTE: The probability we came to in this solution and in other solutions that use Stars and Bars is not exact. Stars and Bars treats all outcomes to be equally likely when in reality some distributions are more likely than others (see clarification above), but the reason we still use it here is because it gives us a good average and the answer choices are pretty far apart so it’s not very significant to our approximation.
