## Problem

In the $xy$ -plane, a circle of radius $4$ with center on the positive $x$ -axis is tangent to the $y$ -axis at the origin, and a circle with radius $10$ with center on the positive $y$ -axis is tangent to the $x$ -axis at the origin. What is the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \dfrac{2}{7} \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \dfrac{3}{7} \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{29}} \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{29}} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \dfrac{2}{5}$

## Solution 1
The center of the first circle is $(4,0)$ . The center of the second circle is $(0,10)$ . Thus, the slope of the line that passes through these two centers is $- \frac{10}{4} = - \frac{5}{2}$ .
Because this line is the perpendicular bisector of the line that passes through two intersecting points of two circles, the slope of the latter line is $\frac{-1}{- \frac{5}{2}} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } \frac{2}{5}}$ .

## Solution 2 (Coordinate Geometry)
The first circle can be written as $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 4^2$ we'll call this equation $(1)$ The second can we writen as $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 10^2$ , we'll call this equation $(2)$
Expanding $(1)$ : \begin{align*} x^2 -8x + 4^2 + y^2 &= 4^2 \\ x^2 - 8x + y^2 &= 0 \end{align*} Exapnding $(2)$ \begin{align*} x^2 + y^2 -20y + 10^2 = 10^2\\ x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0 \end{align*}
Now we can set the equations equal to eachother: \begin{align*} x^2 - 8x + y^2 &= x^2 + y^2 - 20y \\ \frac{8}{20}x &= y \\ \frac{2}{5}x &= y \end{align*} This is in slope intercept form therefore the slope is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } \frac{2}{5}}$ .
