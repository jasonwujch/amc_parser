## Problem

In $\triangle ABC$ , $AB = 6$ , $BC = 7$ , and $CA = 8$ . Point $D$ lies on $\overline{BC}$ , and $\overline{AD}$ bisects $\angle BAC$ . Point $E$ lies on $\overline{AC}$ , and $\overline{BE}$ bisects $\angle ABC$ . The bisectors intersect at $F$ . What is the ratio $AF$ : $FD$ ?

[asy] pair A = (0,0), B=(6,0), C=intersectionpoints(Circle(A,8),Circle(B,7))[0], F=incenter(A,B,C), D=extension(A,F,B,C),E=extension(B,F,A,C); draw(A--B--C--A--D^^B--E); label("$A$",A,SW); label("$B$",B,SE); label("$C$",C,N); label("$D$",D,NE); label("$E$",E,NW); label("$F$",F,1.5*N); [/asy]

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3:2\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 5:3\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 2:1\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 7:3\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 5:2$

## Solution 1
By the angle bisector theorem, $\frac{AB}{AE} = \frac{CB}{CE}$
$\frac{6}{AE} = \frac{7}{8 - AE}$ so $AE = \frac{48}{13}$
Similarly, $CD = 4$ .
There are two ways to solve from here. First way:
Note that $DB = 7 - 4 = 3.$ By the angle bisector theorem on $\triangle ADB,$ $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{DB} = \frac{6}{3}.$ Thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; 2 : 1}$
Second way:
Now, we use mass points . Assign point $C$ a mass of $1$ .
$mC \cdot CD = mB \cdot DB$ , so $mB = \frac{4}{3}$
Similarly, $A$ will have a mass of $\frac{7}{6}$
$mD = mC + mB = 1 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{7}{3}$
So $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{mD}{mA} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; 2 : 1}$

## Solution 2
Denote $[\triangle{ABC}]$ as the area of triangle ABC and let $r$ be the inradius. Also, as above, use the angle bisector theorem to find that $BD = 3$ . There are two ways to continue from here:
$1.$ Note that $F$ is the incenter. Then, $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{[\triangle{AFB}]}{[\triangle{BFD}]} = \frac{AB * \frac{r}{2}}{BD * \frac{r}{2}} = \frac{AB}{BD} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; 2 : 1}$
$2.$ Apply the angle bisector theorem on $\triangle{ABD}$ to get $\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{6}{3} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; 2 : 1}$

## Solution 3
Draw the third angle bisector, and denote the point where this bisector intersects $AB$ as $P$ . Using angle bisector theorem, we see $AE=48/13 , EC=56/13, AP=16/5, PB=14/5$ . Applying Van Aubel's Theorem , $AF/FD=(48/13)/(56/13) + (16/5)/(14/5)=(6/7)+(8/7)=14/7=2/1$ , and so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; 2 : 1}$ .

## Solution 4
One only needs the angle bisector theorem to solve this question.
The question asks for $AF:FD = \frac{AF}{FD}$ . Apply the angle bisector theorem to $\triangle ABD$ to get \[\frac{AF}{FD} = \frac{AB}{BD}.\]
$AB = 6$ is given. To find $BD$ , apply the angle bisector theorem to $\triangle BAC$ to get \[\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{BA}{AC} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}.\]
Since \[BD + DC = BC = 7,\] it is immediately obvious that $BD = 3$ , $DC = 4$ satisfies both equations.
Thus, \[AF:FD = AB:BD = 6:3 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2:1}.\] ~revision by emerald_block

## Solution 5 (Luck-Based)
Note that $AF$ and $BD$ look like medians. Assuming they are medians, we mark the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2:1}$ as we know that the centroid (the point where all medians in a triangle are concurrent) splits a median in a $2:1$ ratio, with the shorter part being closer to the side it bisects. ~ scthecool Note: This is heavily luck based, and if the figure had not been drawn to scale, this answer would have been wrong. It is advised to not use this in a real competition unless absolutely necessary.

## Solution 6 (Cheese)
Assume the drawing is to-scale. Use your allotted ruler to measure out each side. Note that $AB:BC:AC$ is equal to $6:7:8$ .
Measure out the length of $\overline{AF}$ in relation to $\overline{FD}$ . This ratio is approximately $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2:1}$ . Solution by juwushu .
