## Problem

Which of these describes the graph of $x^2(x+y+1)=y^2(x+y+1)$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{two parallel lines}\\ \textbf{(B)}\ \text{two intersecting lines}\\ \textbf{(C)}\ \text{three lines that all pass through a common point}\\ \textbf{(D)}\ \text{three lines that do not all pass through a common point}\\ \textbf{(E)}\ \text{a line and a parabola}$

## Solution 1
The equation $x^2(x+y+1)=y^2(x+y+1)$ tells us $x^2=y^2$ or $x+y+1=0$ . $x^2=y^2$ generates two lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ . $x+y+1=0$ is another straight line. The only intersection of $y=x$ and $y=-x$ is $(0,0)$ , which is not on $x+y+1=0$ . Therefore, the graph is three lines that do not have a common intersection, or $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\; \text{three lines that do not all pass through a common point}}$

## Solution 2
If $x+y+1\neq0$ , then dividing both sides of the equation by $x+y+1$ gives us $x^2=y^2$ . Rearranging and factoring, we get $x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)=0$ . If $x+y+1=0$ , then the equation is satisfied. Thus either $x+y=0$ , $x-y=0$ , or $x+y+1=0$ . These equations can be rearranged into the lines $y=-x$ , $y=x$ , and $y=-x-1$ , respectively. Since these three lines are distinct, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\; \text{three lines that do not all pass through a common point}}$ .

## Solution 3
Subtract $y^2(x+y+1)$ on both sides of the equation to get $x^2(x+y+1)-y^2(x+y+1)=0$ . Factoring $x+y+1$ gives us $(x+y+1)(x^2-y^2)=(x+y+1)(x+y)(x-y)=0$ , so either $x+y+1=0$ , $x+y=0$ , or $x-y=0$ . Continue on with the second half of solution 2.
