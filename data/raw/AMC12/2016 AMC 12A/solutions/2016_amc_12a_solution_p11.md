# 2016 AMC 12A Problem 11

## Problem

Each of the $100$ students in a certain summer camp can either sing, dance, or act. Some students have more than one talent, but no student has all three talents. There are $42$ students who cannot sing, $65$ students who cannot dance, and $29$ students who cannot act. How many students have two of these talents?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 16\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 25\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 49\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 64$

## Solution
Let $a$ be the number of students that can only sing, $b$ can only dance, and $c$ can only act.
Let $ab$ be the number of students that can sing and dance, $ac$ can sing and act, and $bc$ can dance and act.
From the information given in the problem, $a + ab + b = 29, b + bc + c = 42,$ and $a + ac + c = 65$ .
Adding these equations together, we get $2(a + b + c) + ab + bc + ac = 136$ .
Since there are a total of $100$ students, $a + b + c + ab + bc + ac = 100$ .
Subtracting these equations, we get $a + b + c = 36$ .
Our answer is $ab + bc + ac = 100 - (a + b + c) = 100 - 36 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\; 64}$

## Solution 2
An easier way to solve the problem: Since $42$ students cannot sing, there are $100-42=58$ students who can.
Similarly $65$ students cannot dance, there are $100-65=35$ students who can.
And $29$ students cannot act, there are $100-29=71$ students who can.
Therefore, there are $58+35+71=164$ students in all ignoring the overlaps between $2$ of $3$ talent categories. There are no students who have all $3$ talents, nor those who have none $(0)$ , so only $1$ or $2$ talents are viable.
Thus, there are $164-100=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }64}$ students who have $2$ of $3$ talents.

## Solution 3
First, we find the number of students that do not have $2$ of the $3$ talents.
Ignoring overlap, this will be $42+65+29=136$ students.
Accounting for overlap, there will be $136-100=36$ students that do not have $2$ of the $3$ talents.
Note that this is also equal to the number of students that only have $1$ of the $3$ talents
Therefore, the number of students who have $2$ of the $3$ talents is $100-36=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }64}$
