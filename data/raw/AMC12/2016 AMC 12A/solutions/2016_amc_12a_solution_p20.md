# 2016 AMC 12A Problem 20

## Problem

A binary operation $\diamondsuit$ has the properties that $a\,\diamondsuit\, (b\,\diamondsuit \,c) = (a\,\diamondsuit \,b)\cdot c$ and that $a\,\diamondsuit \,a=1$ for all nonzero real numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ . (Here $\cdot$ represents multiplication). The solution to the equation $2016 \,\diamondsuit\, (6\,\diamondsuit\, x)=100$ can be written as $\tfrac{p}{q}$ , where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $p+q?$

$\textbf{(A) }109\qquad\textbf{(B) }201\qquad\textbf{(C) }301\qquad\textbf{(D) }3049\qquad\textbf{(E) }33,601$

## Solution 1
We see that $a \, \diamondsuit \, a = 1$ , and think of division. Testing, we see that the first condition $a \, \diamondsuit \, (b \, \diamondsuit \, c) = (a \, \diamondsuit \, b) \cdot c$ is satisfied, because $\frac{a}{\frac{b}{c}} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot c$ . Therefore, division can be the operation $\diamondsuit$ . Solving the equation, \[\frac{2016}{\frac{6}{x}} = \frac{2016}{6} \cdot x = 336x = 100\implies x=\frac{100}{336} = \frac{25}{84},\] so the answer is $25 + 84 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }109}$ .

## Solution 2 (Proving that is division)
If the given conditions hold for all nonzero numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ ,
Let $a=b=c.$ From the first two givens, this implies that
\[a\diamondsuit\, (a\diamondsuit\, {a})=(a\diamondsuit\, a)\cdot{a}.\]
From $a\diamondsuit\,{a}=1,$ this equation simply becomes $a\diamondsuit\,{1}=a.$
Let $c=b.$ Substituting this into the first two conditions, we see that
\[a\diamondsuit\, (b\diamondsuit\, {c})=(a\diamondsuit\, {b})\cdot{c} \implies a\diamondsuit\, (b\diamondsuit\, {b})=(a\diamondsuit\, {b})\cdot{b}.\]
Substituting $b\diamondsuit\, {b} =1$ , the second equation becomes
\[a\diamondsuit\, {1}=(a\diamondsuit\, {b})\cdot{b} \implies a=(a\diamondsuit\,{b})\cdot{b}.\]
Since $a, b$ and $c$ are nonzero, we can divide by $b$ which yields,
\[\frac{a}{b}=(a\diamondsuit\, {b}).\]
Now we can find the value of $x$ straightforwardly:
\[\frac{2016}{(\frac{6}{x})}=100 \implies 2016=\frac{600}{x} \implies x=\frac{600}{2016} = \frac{25}{84}.\]
Therefore, $a+b=25+84=\boxed{\textbf{A)} 109}$

Note: We only really cared about what $a\diamondsuit\,{b}$ was, so we used the existence of $c$ to get an expression in terms of just $a$ and $b$ .

## Solution 3
One way to eliminate the $\diamondsuit$ in this equation is to make $a = b$ so that $a\,\diamondsuit\, (b\,\diamondsuit \,c) = c$ . In this case, we can make $b = 2016$ .
\[2016 \,\diamondsuit\, (6\,\diamondsuit\, x)=100\implies (2016\, \diamondsuit\, 6) \cdot x = 100\]
By multiplying both sides by $\frac{6}{x}$ , we get:
\[(2016\, \diamondsuit\, 6) \cdot 6 = \frac{600}{x}\implies 2016 \, \diamondsuit\, (6\, \diamondsuit\, 6) = \frac{600}{x}\]
Because $6\, \diamondsuit\, 6 = 2016\, \diamondsuit\, 2016 = 1:$
\[2016 \, \diamondsuit\, (2016\, \diamondsuit\, 2016) = \frac{600}{x}\implies (2016\, \diamondsuit\, 2016) \cdot 2016 = \frac{600}{x}\implies 2016 = \frac{600}{x}\]
Therefore, $x = \frac{600}{2016} = \frac{25}{84}$ , so the answer is $25 + 84 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }109.}$

## Solution 4
We can manipulate the given identities to arrive at a conclusion about the binary operator $\diamondsuit$ . Substituting $b = c$ into the first identity yields \[( a\ \diamondsuit\ b) \cdot b = a\ \diamondsuit\ (b\ \diamondsuit\ b) = a\ \diamondsuit\ 1 = a\ \diamondsuit\ ( a\ \diamondsuit\ a) = ( a\ \diamondsuit\ a) \cdot a = a.\] Hence, $( a\ \diamondsuit\ b) \cdot b = a,$ or, dividing both sides of the equation by $b,$ $( a\ \diamondsuit\ b) = \frac{a}{b}.$
Hence, the given equation becomes $\frac{2016}{\frac{6}{x}} = 100$ . Solving yields $x=\frac{100}{336} = \frac{25}{84},$ so the answer is $25 + 84 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }109.}$

## Solution 5
$2016 \diamondsuit (6 \diamondsuit x) = (2016 \diamondsuit 6) \cdot x = 100$
$2016 \diamondsuit (2016 \diamondsuit 1) = (2016 \diamondsuit 2016) \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$
$2016 \diamondsuit 2016 = 1$ , $2016 \diamondsuit (2016 \diamondsuit 1) = 1$ , so $2016 \diamondsuit 1 = 2016$
$2016 \diamondsuit 1 = (2016 \diamondsuit 6) \cdot 6$ , $2016 \diamondsuit 6 = \frac{2016 \diamondsuit 1}{6} = 336$
$x = \frac{100}{2016 \diamondsuit 6} = \frac{100}{336} = \frac{25}{84}$ , $24 + 85 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }109}$

## Solution 6 (Fast)
First, looking at the conditions, we know that any nonzero real number $a$ satisfies: $a \diamondsuit (a \diamondsuit a) = (a \diamondsuit a) \cdot a$ Using the next condition, we get that: $a \diamondsuit 1 = a$
Notice that $2016 \diamondsuit 1 = 2016 \diamondsuit (6 \diamondsuit 6) = (2016 \diamondsuit 6) \cdot 6 = 2016$ . Hence, $2016 \diamondsuit 6 = 336$ . Thus, $2016 \diamondsuit (6 \diamondsuit x)=100 \implies (2016 \diamondsuit 6) \cdot x = 100 \implies 336x=100 \implies x=\frac{25}{84}$ . Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }109}$

## Solution 7
We can rewrite $2016\diamondsuit (6\diamondsuit x)=100$ as $2016\diamondsuit 6=\dfrac{100}x.$ We do a series of algebraic manipulations:
\[(2016\diamondsuit 6)\cdot6=\dfrac{600}x\] \[2016\diamondsuit (6\diamondsuit 6)=\dfrac{600}x\] \[2016\diamondsuit 1=\dfrac{600}x.\]
Let $a=2016\diamondsuit 1.$
\[2016a=(2016\diamondsuit 1)\cdot 2016\] \[2016a=2016\diamondsuit (1\diamondsuit 2016)\]
We let $b=1\diamondsuit 2016.$
\[2016b=(1\diamondsuit 2016)\cdot2016\] \[2016b=1\diamondsuit (2016\diamondsuit 2016)\] \[2016b=1\diamondsuit 1=1\] \[b=\dfrac1{2016}\]
We notice that $1\diamondsuit 2016=\dfrac1{2016},$ which makes $a\diamondsuit b$ look suspiciously like $\dfrac ab.$ Sure enough, when we try the given condition on $a\diamondsuit b=\dfrac ab,$ we see that it works. We evaluate $2016\diamondsuit (6\diamondsuit x)=100,$ and get $x=\dfrac{25}{84},$ and therefore $p+q=25+84=109.$
