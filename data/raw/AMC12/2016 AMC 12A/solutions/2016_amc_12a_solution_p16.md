## Problem

The graphs of $y=\log_3 x, y=\log_x 3, y=\log_\frac{1}{3} x,$ and $y=\log_x \dfrac{1}{3}$ are plotted on the same set of axes. How many points in the plane with positive $x$ -coordinates lie on two or more of the graphs?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 6$

## Solution
Setting the first two equations equal to each other, $\log_3 x = \log_x 3$ .
Solving this, we get $\left(3, 1\right)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{3}, -1\right)$ .
Similarly with the last two equations, we get $\left(3, -1\right)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{3}, 1\right)$ .
Now, by setting the first and third equations equal to each other, we get $\left(1, 0\right)$ .
Pairing the first and fourth or second and third equations won't work because then $\log x \leq 0$ .
Pairing the second and fourth equations will yield $x = 1$ , but since you can't divide by $\log 1 = 0$ , it doesn't work.
After trying all pairs, we have a total of $5$ solutions $\rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(D)} 5}$

## Solution 2
Note that $\log_b a =\log_c a / \log_c b$ .
Then $\log_b a = \log_a a / \log_a b = 1/ \log_a b$
$\log_\frac{1}{a} b = \log_a \frac{1}{a} / \log_a b = -1/ \log_a b$
$\log_\frac{1}{b} a = -\log_a b$
Therefore, the system of equations can be simplified to:
$y = t$
$y = -t$
$y = \frac{1}{t}$
$y = -\frac{1}{t}$
where $t = \log_3 x$ . Note that all values of $t$ correspond to exactly one positive $x$ value, so all $(t,y)$ intersections will correspond to exactly one $(x,y)$ intersection in the positive-x area.
Graphing this system of functions will generate a total of $5$ solutions $\rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(D)} 5}$
