## Problem

Bertha has 6 daughters and no sons. Some of her daughters have 6 daughters, and the rest have none. Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and grand-daughters have no daughters?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 22 \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 23 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 24 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 25 \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 26$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
Since Bertha has $6$ daughters, she has $30-6=24$ granddaughters, of which none have daughters. Of Bertha's daughters, $\frac{24}6=4$ have daughters, so $6-4=2$ do not have daughters. Therefore, of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters, $24+2=26$ do not have daughters. $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 26}$

## Solution 2 (From Alcumus)
Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \boxed{26}$ .

## Solution 3
Draw a tree diagram and see that the answer can be found in the sum of $6+6$ granddaughters, $5+5$ daughters, and $4$ more daughters. Adding them together gives the answer of $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 26}$ .
