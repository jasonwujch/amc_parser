# 2004 AMC 12A Problem 5

## Problem

The graph of the line $y=mx+b$ is shown. Which of the following is true?

$\mathrm {(A)} mb<-1 \qquad \mathrm {(B)} -1<mb<0 \qquad \mathrm {(C)} mb=0 \qquad \mathrm {(D)}$ $0<mb<1 \qquad \mathrm {(E)} mb>1$

## Solution
The line appears to have a slope of $-\dfrac{1}{2}$ and y-intercept of $\dfrac{4}{5}$ up.
$\dfrac{4}{5}\cdot \dfrac{-1}{2}=\dfrac{-4}{10} \Rightarrow \mathrm {(B)}$
