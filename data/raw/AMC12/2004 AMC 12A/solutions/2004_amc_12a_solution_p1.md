# 2004 AMC 12A Problem 1

## Problem

Alicia earns 20 dollars per hour, of which $1.45\%$ is deducted to pay local taxes. How many cents per hour of Alicia's wages are used to pay local taxes?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 0.0029 \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } 0.029 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 0.29 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } 2.9 \qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } 29$

## Solution
$20$ dollars is the same as $2000$ cents, and $1.45\%$ of $2000$ is $0.0145\times2000=29$ cents. $\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 29}$ .
Since there can't be decimal values of cents, the answer must be $\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 29}$ .
