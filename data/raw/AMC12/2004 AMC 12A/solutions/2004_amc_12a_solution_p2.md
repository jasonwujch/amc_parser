# 2004 AMC 12A Problem 2

## Problem

On the AMC 12, each correct answer is worth $6$ points, each incorrect answer is worth $0$ points, and each problem left unanswered is worth $2.5$ points. If Charlyn leaves $8$ of the $25$ problems unanswered, how many of the remaining problems must she answer correctly in order to score at least $100$ ?

$\text {(A)} 11 \qquad \text {(B)} 13 \qquad \text {(C)} 14 \qquad \text {(D)} 16\qquad \text {(E)}17$

## Solution
She gets $8*2.5=20$ points for the problems she didn't answer. She must get $\left\lceil \frac{100-20}{6} \right\rceil =14 \Rightarrow \text {(C)}$ problems right to score at least 100.
