## Problem

Two right circular cylinders have the same volume. The radius of the second cylinder is $10\%$ more than the radius of the first. What is the relationship between the heights of the two cylinders?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{The second height is } 10\% \text{ less than the first.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \text{The first height is } 10\% \text{ more than the second.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \text{The second height is } 21\% \text{ less than the first.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \text{The first height is } 21\% \text{ more than the second.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \text{The second height is } 80\% \text{ of the first.}$

## Solution
Let the radius of the first cylinder be $r_1$ and the radius of the second cylinder be $r_2$ . Also, let the height of the first cylinder be $h_1$ and the height of the second cylinder be $h_2$ . We are told \[r_2=\frac{11r_1}{10}\] \[\pi r_1^2h_1=\pi r_2^2h_2\] Substituting the first equation into the second and dividing both sides by $\pi$ , we get \[r_1^2h_1=\frac{121r_1^2}{100}h_2\implies h_1=\frac{121h_2}{100}.\] Therefore, $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \text{The first height is } 21\% \text{ more than the second.}}$
