# 2015 AMC 12A Problem 3

## Problem

Mr. Patrick teaches math to $15$ students. He was grading tests and found that when he graded everyone's test except Payton's, the average grade for the class was $80$ . After he graded Payton's test, the test average became $81$ . What was Payton's score on the test?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 81\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 85\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 91\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 94\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 95$

## Solution
If the average of the first $14$ peoples' scores was $80$ , then the sum of all of their tests is $14 \cdot 80 = 1120$ . When Payton's score was added, the sum of all of the scores became $15 \cdot 81 = 1215$ . So, Payton's score must be $1215-1120 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }95}$

## Alternate Solution
The average of a set of numbers is the value we get if we evenly distribute the total across all entries. So assume that the first $14$ students each scored $80$ . If Payton also scored an $80$ , the average would still be $80$ . In order to increase the overall average to $81$ , we need to add one more point to all of the scores, including Payton's. This means we need to add a total of $15$ more points, so Payton needs $80+15 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }95}$
