# 2015 AMC 12A Problem 11

## Problem

On a sheet of paper, Isabella draws a circle of radius $2$ , a circle of radius $3$ , and all possible lines simultaneously tangent to both circles. Isabella notices that she has drawn exactly $k \ge 0$ lines. How many different values of $k$ are possible?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 3 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 6$

## Solution
Isabella can get $0$ lines if the circles are concentric, $1$ if internally tangent, $2$ if overlapping, $3$ if externally tangent, and $4$ if non-overlapping and not externally tangent. There are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 5}$ values of $k$ .
