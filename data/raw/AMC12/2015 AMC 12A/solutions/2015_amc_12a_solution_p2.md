## Problem

Two of the three sides of a triangle are 20 and 15. Which of the following numbers is not a possible perimeter of the triangle?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 52\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 57\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 62\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 67\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 72$

## Solution
Letting $x$ be the third side, then by the triangle inequality, $20-15 < x < 20+15$ , or $5 < x < 35$ . Therefore the perimeter must be greater than 40 but less than 70. 72 is not in this range, so $\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \, 72}$ is our answer.
