## Solutions

## Solution 1
First, we draw the vertical cross-section passing through the middle of the frustum. let the top base equal 2 and the bottom base to be equal to 2r [asy] size(7cm); pair A,B,C,D; real r = (3+sqrt(5))/2; real s = sqrt(r); A = (-r,0); B = (r,0); C = (1,2*s); D = (-1,2*s); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle); pair O = (0,s); draw(shift(O)*scale(s)*unitcircle); dot(O); pair X,Y; X = (0,0); Y = (0,2*s); draw(X--Y); label("$r-1$",(X+B)/2,S); label("$1$",(Y+C)/2,N); label("$s$",(O+Y)/2,W); label("$s$",(O+X)/2,W); draw(B--C--(1,0)--cycle,blue+1bp); pair P = 0.73*C+0.27*B; draw(O--P); dot(P); label("$1$",(C+P)/2,NE); label("$r$",(B+P)/2,NE); [/asy]
then using the Pythagorean theorem we have: $(r+1)^2=(2s)^2+(r-1)^2$ which is equivalent to: $r^2+2r+1=4s^2+r^2-2r+1$ subtracting $r^2-2r+1$ from both sides $4r=4s^2$ solving for s we get: \[s=\sqrt{r}\] next we can find the volume of the frustum and of the sphere and we know $V_{\text{frustum}}=2V_{\text{sphere}}$ so we can solve for $s$ using $V_{\text{frustum}}=\frac{\pi*h}{3}(R^2+r^2+Rr)$ we get: \[V_{\text{frustum}}=\frac{\pi*2\sqrt{r}}{3}(r^2+r+1)\] using $V_{\text{sphere}}=\dfrac{4s^{3}\pi}{3}$ we get \[V_{\text{sphere}}=\dfrac{4(\sqrt{r})^{3}\pi}{3}\] so we have: \[\frac{\pi*2\sqrt{r}}{3}(r^2+r+1)=2*\dfrac{4(\sqrt{r})^{3}\pi}{3}\] dividing by $\frac{2\pi*\sqrt{r}}{3}$ we get \[r^2+r+1=4r\] which is equivalent to \[r^2-3r+1=0\] $r=\dfrac{3\pm\sqrt{(-3)^2-4*1*1}}{2*1}$ so \[r=\dfrac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}\longrightarrow \boxed{E}\]

## Solution 2(ADD DIAGRAM)
Let's once again look at the cross section of the frustum. Let the angle from the center of the sphere to a point on the circumference of the bottom circle be $\theta.$ This implies that the angle from the center of the sphere to a point on the circumference of the top circle is $90 - \theta.$ Hence the bottom radius is $r\tan{\theta}$ and the top radius is $\frac {r}{\tan {\theta}}.$ This means that the radio between the bottom radius and top radius is $(\tan {\theta})^2.$ Using the frustum volume formula, we find that the are of this figure is $\frac{2\pi r}{3}(r^2(\tan {\theta})^2 + r^2 + \frac {r^2} {(\tan {\theta})^2}).$ We can equate this to $\frac {8\pi*r^3} 3.$ Simplifying, we are left with a quadratic conveniently in $(\tan {\theta})^2.$ The quadratic is $(\tan {\theta})^4 - 3(\tan {\theta})^2 + 1 = 0.$ This gives us $(\tan {\theta})^2 = \dfrac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}\longrightarrow \boxed{E}$

### Remark
For problems that involve a circle inscribed into an isosceles trapezoid, the following fact is very useful. If we let the bases be $x$ and $y$ , and the height be $h$ , then $h = \sqrt{xy}$ . Then, we could solve from solution 1 directly knowing the radius in terms of the base. By letting the upper base be $1$ and the lower base be $x$ , we can find $r$ in terms of $x$ , and solve like in solution one. ~Puck_0
