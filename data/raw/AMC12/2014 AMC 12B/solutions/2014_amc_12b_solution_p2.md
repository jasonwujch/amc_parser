## Problem

Orvin went to the store with just enough money to buy $30$ balloons. When he arrived he discovered that the store had a special sale on balloons: buy $1$ balloon at the regular price and get a second at $\frac{1}{3}$ off the regular price. What is the greatest number of balloons Orvin could buy?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 33\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 34\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 38\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 39$

## Solution 1
If every balloon costs $n$ dollars, then Orvin has $30n$ dollars. For every balloon he buys for $n$ dollars, he can buy another for $\frac{2n}{3}$ dollars. This means it costs him $\frac{5n}{3}$ dollars to buy a bundle of $2$ balloons. With $30n$ dollars, he can buy $\frac{30n}{\frac{5n}{3}} = 18$ sets of two balloons, so the total number of balloons he can buy is $18\times2 \implies \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 36 }$

## Solution 2
Similar to solution 1, but quicker. We see the fraction $\frac13,$ so we let each balloon cost $\$3$ WLOG. Thus, Orvin has $\$3\cdot30=\$90.$ Each pair of balloons (one full-priced and one a third off) costs $\$3+\left(1-\frac13\right)\cdot\$3=\$3+\$2=\$5.$ Therefore, Orvin can buy $\frac{\$90}{\$5}=18$ pairs of balloons, at maximum. $18\cdot2=36$ balloons. ~Technodoggo
