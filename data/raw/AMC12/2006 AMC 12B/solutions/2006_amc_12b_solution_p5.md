# 2006 AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

John is walking east at a speed of 3 miles per hour, while Bob is also walking east, but at a speed of 5 miles per hour. If Bob is now 1 mile west of John, how many minutes will it take for Bob to catch up to John?

$\text {(A) } 30 \qquad \text {(B) } 50 \qquad \text {(C) } 60 \qquad \text {(D) } 90 \qquad \text {(E) } 120$

## Solution
The speed that Bob is catching up to John is $5-3=2$ miles per hour. Since Bob is one mile behind John, it will take $\frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \text{(A)}$ of an hour to catch up to John.
