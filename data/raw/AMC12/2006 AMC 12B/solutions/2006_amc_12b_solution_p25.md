# 2006 AMC 12B Problem 25

## Problem

A sequence $a_1,a_2,\dots$ of non-negative integers is defined by the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\geq 1$ . If $a_1=999$ , $a_2<999$ and $a_{2006}=1$ , how many different values of $a_2$ are possible?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 165 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 324 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 495 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 499 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 660$

## Solution 1
We say the sequence $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ if $i$ is the minimal positive integer such that $a_i = a_{i + 1} = 1$ . Otherwise, we say $(a_n)$ does not complete.
Note that if $d = \gcd(999, a_2) \neq 1$ , then $d|a_n$ for all $n \geq 1$ , and $d$ does not divide $1$ , so if $\gcd(999, a_2) \neq 1$ , then $(a_n)$ does not complete. (Also, $a_{2006}$ cannot be 1 in this case since $d$ does not divide $1$ , so we do not care about these $a_2$ at all.)
From now on, suppose $\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$ .
We will now show that $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \leq 2006$ . We will do this with 3 lemmas.
Lemma: If $a_j \neq a_{j + 1}$ , and neither value is $0$ , then $\max(a_j, a_{j + 1}) > \max(a_{j + 2}, a_{j + 3})$ .
Proof: There are 2 cases to consider.
If $a_j > a_{j + 1}$ , then $a_{j + 2} = a_j - a_{j + 1}$ , and $a_{j + 3} = |a_j - 2a_{j + 1}|$ . So $a_j > a_{j + 2}$ and $a_j > a_{j + 3}$ .
If $a_j < a_{j + 1}$ , then $a_{j + 2} = a_{j + 1} - a_j$ , and $a_{j + 3} = a_j$ . So $a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 2}$ and $a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 3}$ .
In both cases, $\max(a_j, a_{j + 1}) > \max(a_{j + 2}, a_{j + 3})$ , as desired.
Lemma: If $a_i = a_{i + 1}$ , then $a_i = 1$ . Moreover, if instead we have $a_i = 0$ for some $i > 2$ , then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2} = 1$ .
Proof: By the way $(a_n)$ is constructed in the problem statement, having two equal consecutive terms $a_i = a_{i + 1}$ implies that $a_i$ divides every term in the sequence. So $a_i | 999$ and $a_i | a_2$ , so $a_i | \gcd(999, a_2) = 1$ , so $a_i = 1$ . For the proof of the second result, note that if $a_i = 0$ , then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2}$ , so by the first result we just proved, $a_{i - 2} = a_{i - 1} = 1$ .
Lemma: $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \leq 2000$ .
Proof: Suppose $(a_n)$ completed at some $i > 2000$ or not at all. Then by the second lemma and the fact that neither $999$ nor $a_2$ are $0$ , none of the pairs $(a_1, a_2), ..., (a_{1999}, a_{2000})$ can have a $0$ or be equal to $(1, 1)$ . So the first lemma implies \[\max(a_1, a_2) > \max(a_3, a_4) > \cdots > \max(a_{1999}, a_{2000}) > 0,\] so $999 = \max(a_1, a_2) \geq 1000$ , a contradiction. Hence $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \leq 2000$ .
Now we're ready to find exactly which values of $a_2$ we want to count.
Let's keep in mind that $2006 \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ and that $a_1 = 999$ is odd. We have two cases to consider.
Case 1: If $a_2$ is odd, then $a_3$ is even, so $a_4$ is odd, so $a_5$ is odd, so $a_6$ is even, and this pattern must repeat every three terms because of the recursive definition of $(a_n)$ , so the terms of $(a_n)$ reduced modulo 2 are \[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...,\] so $a_{2006}$ is odd and hence $1$ (since if $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ , then $a_k$ must be $0$ or $1$ for all $k \geq i$ ).
Case 2: If $a_2$ is even, then $a_3$ is odd, so $a_4$ is odd, so $a_5$ is even, so $a_6$ is odd, and this pattern must repeat every three terms, so the terms of $(a_n)$ reduced modulo 2 are \[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ...,\] so $a_{2006}$ is even, and hence $0$ .
We have found that $a_{2006} = 1$ is true precisely when $\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$ and $a_2$ is odd. This tells us what we need to count.
There are $\phi(999) = 648$ numbers less than $999$ and relatively prime to it ( $\phi$ is the Euler totient function). We want to count how many of these are odd. Note that \[t \mapsto 999 - t\] is a 1-1 correspondence between the odd and even numbers less than and relatively prime to $999$ . So our final answer is $648/2 = 324$ , or $\boxed{\text{B}}$ .

## Solution 2 (estimation)
As in Solution 1, we show that $a_2$ must be odd. We notice that, after experimentation, all numbers eventually end up in a sequence $1,1,0,1,1,0,\ldots$ , which points to the assumption that every $2$ out of $3$ values for $a_2$ work due to residue classes. Combining this with an estimated 50-50 chance that these values are either odd or even, since $999$ values are nonnegative integers less than $999$ , we can estimate that there are about $999\cdot\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=333$ different values of $a_2$ that work. The closest answer choice by far is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }324}$ .

## Solution 3 (PIE)
Notice that if $a_2$ is not relatively prime to $999 = 3^3\cdot 37$ , then all elements in the sequence will be a multiple of 3 or 37, i.e. it cannot be 1. In addition, if $a_2$ is even, then $a_{2006}$ must also be even, so $a_{2006}\neq 1$ . For all other possible $a_2$ (those relatively prime to 2, 3, and 37), the sequence will become $...,1,1,0,1,1,0,...$ where $a_{2006}=1$ . From PIE, the complement is \[\left(\left\lfloor\frac{999}{2}\right\rfloor+1\right)+\left(\left\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\right\rfloor+1\right)+\left(\left\lfloor\frac{999}{37}\right\rfloor+1\right)-\left(\left\lfloor\frac{999}{2\cdot3}\right\rfloor+1\right)-\left(\left\lfloor\frac{999}{2\cdot 37}\right\rfloor+1\right)-\left(\left\lfloor\frac{999}{3\cdot37}\right\rfloor+1\right)+\left(\left\lfloor\frac{999}{2\cdot3\cdot37}\right\rfloor+1\right)=676\] Note the +1 in each term because we have to include 0. So the answer is $1000-676=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }324}$ .
