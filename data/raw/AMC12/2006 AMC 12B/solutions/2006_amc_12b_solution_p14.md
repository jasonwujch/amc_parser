## Problem

Elmo makes $N$ sandwiches for a fundraiser. For each sandwich he uses $B$ globs of peanut butter at $4$ cents per glob and $J$ blobs of jam at $5$ cents per glob. The cost of the peanut butter and jam to make all the sandwiches is $2.53$ . Assume that $B$ , $J$ and $N$ are all positive integers with $N>1$ . What is the cost of the jam Elmo uses to make the sandwiches?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 1.05 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 1.25 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 1.45 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 1.65 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 1.85$

## Solution
From the given, we know that
$253=N(4B+5J)$ (The numbers are in cents)
since $253=11\cdot23$ , and since $N$ is an integer, then $4B+5J=11$ or $23$ . It is easily deduced that $11$ is impossible to make with $B$ and $J$ integers, so $N=11$ and $4B+5J=23$ . Then, it can be guessed and checked quite simply that if $B=2$ and $J=3$ , then $4B+5J=4(2)+5(3)=23$ . The problem asks for the total cost of jam, or $N(5J)=11(15)=165$ cents, or $1.65\implies\mathrm{(D)}$
