# 2006 AMC 12B Problem 3

## Problem

A football game was played between two teams, the Cougars and the Panthers. The two teams scored a total of 34 points, and the Cougars won by a margin of 14 points. How many points did the Panthers score?

$\text {(A) } 10 \qquad \text {(B) } 14 \qquad \text {(C) } 17 \qquad \text {(D) } 20 \qquad \text {(E) } 24$

## Solution

## Solution 1
If the Cougars won by a margin of 14 points, then the Panthers' score would be half of (34-14). That's 10 $\Rightarrow \boxed{\text{(A)}}$ .

## Solution 2
Let the Panthers' score be $x$ . The Cougars then scored $x+14$ . Since the teams combined scored $34$ , we get $x+x+14=34 \\ \rightarrow 2x+14=34 \\ \rightarrow 2x=20 \\ \rightarrow x = 10$ ,
and the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A)}}$ .
