## Problem

Compute the sum of all the roots of $(2x+3)(x-4)+(2x+3)(x-6)=0$

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{7}{2}\qquad \textbf{(B) } 4\qquad \textbf{(C) } 5\qquad \textbf{(D) } 7\qquad \textbf{(E) } 13$

## Solution 1
We expand to get $2x^2-8x+3x-12+2x^2-12x+3x-18=0$ which is $4x^2-14x-30=0$ after combining like terms. Using the quadratic part of Vieta's Formulas , we find the sum of the roots is $\frac{14}4 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }7/2}$ .

## Solution 2
We see a $(2x+3)$ term in both addends so we can factor the equation to $(2x+3)((x-4)+(x-6))=(2x+3)(2x-10)=0.$ The two roots become obvious: they are $-\frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{10}{2}.$ Adding these two gives $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }7/2}.$
