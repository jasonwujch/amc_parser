## Problem

For how many positive integers $m$ does there exist at least one positive integer n such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 4\qquad \textbf{(B) } 6\qquad \textbf{(C) } 9\qquad \textbf{(D) } 12\qquad \textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many}$

## Solution 1
For any $m$ we can pick $n=1$ , we get $m \cdot 1 \le m + 1$ , therefore the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many}}$ .

## Solution 2
Another solution, slightly similar to this first one would be using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick .
$(m-1)(n-1) \leq 1$
Let $n=1$ , then
$0 \leq 1$
This means that there are infinitely many numbers $m$ that can satisfy the inequality. So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many}}$ .

## Solution 3
If we subtract $n$ from both sides of the equation, we get $m \cdot n - n \le m$ . Factor the left side to get $(m - 1)(n) \le m$ . Divide both sides by $(m-1)$ and we get $n \le \frac {m}{m-1}$ . The fraction $\frac {m}{m-1} > 1$ if $m > 1$ . There is an infinite amount of integers greater than $1$ , therefore the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many}}$ .
