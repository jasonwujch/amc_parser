## Problem

The nonzero coefficients of a polynomial $P$ with real coefficients are all replaced by their mean to form a polynomial $Q$ . Which of the following could be a graph of $y = P(x)$ and $y = Q(x)$ over the interval $-4\leq x \leq 4$ ?

## Solution 1
The sum of the coefficients of $P$ and of $Q$ will be equal, so $P(1) = Q(1)$ . The only answer choice with an intersection between the two graphs at $x = 1$ is (B) . (The polynomials in the graph are $P(x) = 2x^4-3x^2-3x-4$ and $Q(x) = -2x^4-2x^2-2x-2$ .)

## Solution 2
We know every coefficient is equal, so we get $ax^n + ... + ax + a = 0$ which equals $x^n + ... + x + 1 = 0$ . We see apparently that x cannot be positive, for it would yield a number greater than zero for $Q(x)$ . We look at the zeros of the answer choices. A, C, D, and E have a positive zero, which eliminates them. B is the answer.

## Solution 2a
Proceed similarly to Solution 2. However, note that $x^n + ... + x + 1$ is a factor of $x^{n+1}-1.$ The only potential zeroes of $x^{n+1}-1$ are $1$ and $-1$ if $n+1$ is even. Since none of the graphs have a zero at exactly negative one, the solution is the graph with no zeroes, which is $\boxed{(B)}.$
