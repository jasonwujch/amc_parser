## Problem

Tina randomly selects two distinct numbers from the set $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$ , and Sergio randomly selects a number from the set $\{ 1, 2, ..., 10 \}$ . What is the probability that Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina?

$\text{(A)}\ 2/5 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 9/20 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 1/2 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 11/20 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 24/25$

## Solution 1
This is not too bad using casework.
Tina gets a sum of 3: This happens in only one way $(1,2)$ and Sergio can choose a number from 4 to 10, inclusive. There are 7 ways that Sergio gets a desirable number here.
Tina gets a sum of 4: This once again happens in only one way $(1,3)$ . Sergio can choose a number from 5 to 10, so 6 ways here.
Tina gets a sum of 5: This can happen in two ways $(1,4)$ and $(2,3)$ . Sergio can choose a number from 6 to 10, so $2\cdot5=10$ ways here.
Tina gets a sum of 6: Two ways here $(1,5)$ and $(2,4)$ . Sergio can choose a number from 7 to 10, so $2\cdot4=8$ here.
Tina gets a sum of 7: Two ways here $(2,5)$ and $(3,4)$ . Sergio can choose from 8 to 10, so $2\cdot3=6$ ways here.
Tina gets a sum of 8: Only one way possible $(3,5$ ). Sergio chooses 9 or 10, so 2 ways here.
Tina gets a sum of 9: Only one way $(4,5)$ . Sergio must choose 10, so 1 way.
In all, there are $7+6+10+8+6+2+1=40$ ways. Tina chooses two distinct numbers in $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways while Sergio chooses a number in $10$ ways, so there are $10\cdot 10=100$ ways in all. Since $\frac{40}{100}=\frac{2}{5}$ , our answer is $\boxed{\text{(A)}\frac{2}{5}}$ .

## Solution 2
We invoke some symmetry. Let $T$ denote Tina's sum, and let $S$ denote Sergio's number. Observe that, for $i = 2, 3, \ldots, 10$ , $\text{Pr}(T=i) = \text{Pr}(T=12-i)$ .
If Tina's sum is $i$ , then the probability that Sergio's number is larger than Tina's sum is $\frac{10-i}{10}$ . Thus, the probability $P$ is
\[P = \text{Pr}(S>T) = \sum_{i=2}^{10} \text{Pr}(T=i) \times \frac{10-i}{10}\]
Using the symmetry observation, we can also write the above sum as \[P = \sum_{i=2}^{10} \text{Pr}(T=12-i) \times \frac{10-i}{10} = \sum_{i=2}^{10} \text{Pr}(T=i) \times \frac{i-2}{10}\] where the last equality follows as we reversed the indices of the sum (by replacing $12-i$ with $i$ ). Thus, adding the two equivalent expressions for $P$ , we have
\begin{align*} 2P &= \sum_{i=2}^{10} \text{Pr}(T=i) \times \left(\frac{10-i}{10} + \frac{i-2}{10}\right) \\ &= \sum_{i=2}^{10} \text{Pr}(T=i) \times \frac{4}{5} \\ &= \frac{4}{5} \sum_{i=2}^{10} \text{Pr}(T=i) \\ &= \frac{4}{5} \end{align*}
Since this represents twice the desired probability, the answer is $P = \boxed{\textbf{(A)} \frac{2}{5}}$ . -scrabbler94

## Solution 3
We have 4 cases, if Tina chooses $1, 2, 3,$ or $4$ and always chooses numbers greater than the first number she chose.
The number of ways of choosing 2 numbers from $5$ are $\binom{5}{2}$ .
Case 1: Tina chooses $1$ .
In this case, since the numbers are distinct, Tina can choose $(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4),$ or $(1, 5).$
If Tina chooses $1$ and $2$ which sum to $3$ , Sergio only has $10-3=7$ choices.
Since the sum of the combined numbers increases by $1$ every time for this specific case, Sergio has $1$ less choice every time.
Therefore, the probability of this is $\frac{7+6+5+4}{10 \cdot \binom{5}{2}}$ .
Case 2: Tina chooses $2$ .
In this case, Tina can choose $(2, 3), (2, 4),$ or $(2, 5).$
If Tina chooses $2$ and $3$ which sum to $5$ , Sergio only has $10-5=5$ choices.
Since the sum of the combined numbers increases by $1$ every time for this specific case, Sergio has $1$ less choice every time.
Therefore, the probability of this is $\frac{5+4+3}{10 \cdot \binom{5}{2}}$ .
Case 3: Tina chooses $3$ .
In this case, Tina can choose $(3, 4),$ or $(3, 5).$
If Tina chooses $3$ and $4$ which sum to $7$ , Sergio only has $10-7=3$ choices.
Since the sum of the combined numbers increases by $1$ every time for this specific case, Sergio has $1$ less choice every time.
Therefore, the probability of this is $\frac{3+2}{10 \cdot \binom{5}{2}}$ .
Case 4: Tina chooses $4$ .
In this case, Tina can only choose $(4,5).$
If Tina chooses $4$ and $5$ which sum to $9$ , Sergio only has $10-9=1$ choice.
Therefore, the probability of this is $\frac{1}{10 \cdot \binom{5}{2}}$ .
Once you add these probabilities up, you will have $\frac{(7+6+5+4)+(5+4+3)+(3+2)+(1)}{10 \cdot\binom{5}{2}} = \frac{40}{100} = \frac{2}{5}$ probability.
Thus our answer is $\frac{2}{5}$ .

## Solution 4
Assume Sergio chooses from ${2,3,\ldots,10}$ . The probability of Tina getting a sum of $6+x$ and a sum of $6-x$ , where $x \leq 4$ , are equal due to symmetry. The probability of Sergio choosing numbers higher/lower than $6+x$ is equal to him choosing numbers lower/higher than $6-x$ . Therefore over all of Tina's sums, the probability of Sergio choosing a number higher is equal to the probability of choosing a number lower.
The probability that they get the same value is $1/9$ , so the probability of Sergio getting a higher number is $\frac{(9-1)/2}{9} = \frac49$ .
Sergio never wins when choosing $1$ so the probability is $\frac49 \cdot \frac{9}{10} + (0)\frac{1}{10} = \boxed{\textbf{(A)} \frac{2}{5}}.$

## Solution 5 (Brute Force)
List all the cases where $S \in [1, 10]$ and you get $\frac{0+0+0+1+2+4+6+8+9+10}{\binom{5}{2} \cdot 10} = \boxed{\textbf{(A)} \frac{2}{5}}$
