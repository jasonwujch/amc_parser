# 2022 AMC 12B Problem 6

## Problem

Consider the following $100$ sets of $10$ elements each: \begin{align*} &\{1,2,3,\ldots,10\}, \\ &\{11,12,13,\ldots,20\},\\ &\{21,22,23,\ldots,30\},\\ &\vdots\\ &\{991,992,993,\ldots,1000\}. \end{align*} How many of these sets contain exactly two multiples of $7$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 40\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 42\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 43\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 49\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 50$

## Solution 1 (Competition)
There are \(\text{floor}\left(\frac{1000}{7}\right) = 142\) numbers divisible by 7. We split these into 100 sets containing 10 numbers each, giving us 1.42 multiples of 7 per set. After the first set, the numbers come evenly, and we multiply 100 by $1.42 - 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 42}.$

## Solution 2 (Casework)
We apply casework to this problem. The only sets that contain two multiples of seven are those for which:
1. The multiples of $7$ are $1\pmod{10}$ and $8\pmod{10}.$ That is, the first and eighth elements of such sets are multiples of $7.$
1. The multiples of $7$ are $2\pmod{10}$ and $9\pmod{10}.$ That is, the second and ninth elements of such sets are multiples of $7.$
1. The multiples of $7$ are $3\pmod{10}$ and $0\pmod{10}.$ That is, the third and tenth elements of such sets are multiples of $7.$
The first element is $1+10k$ for some integer $0\leq k\leq99.$ It is a multiple of $7$ when $k=2,9,16,\ldots,93.$
The second element is $2+10k$ for some integer $0\leq k\leq99.$ It is a multiple of $7$ when $k=4,11,18,\ldots,95.$
The third element is $3+10k$ for some integer $0\leq k\leq99.$ It is a multiple of $7$ when $k=6,13,20,\ldots,97.$
Each case has $\left\lfloor\frac{100}{7}\right\rfloor=14$ sets. Therefore, the answer is $14\cdot3=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 42}.$

## Solution 3 (Find A Pattern)
We find a pattern. \begin{align*} &\{1,2,3,\ldots,10\}, \\ &\{11,12,13,\ldots,20\},\\ &\{21,22,23,\ldots,30\},\\ &\vdots\\ &\{991,992,993,\ldots,1000\}. \end{align*} We can figure out that the first set has $1$ multiple of $7$ . The second set also has $1$ multiple of $7$ . The third set has $2$ multiples of $7$ . The fourth set has $1$ multiple of $7$ . The fifth set has $2$ multiples of $7$ . The sixth set has $1$ multiple of $7$ . The seventh set has $1$ multiple of $7$ . The eighth set has $2$ multiples of $7$ . Disregarding the first set and then calculating this pattern further, we can see (reasonably) that it repeats for each $1$ sets. We see that the pattern for the number of multiples per $7$ sets (again, disregarding the first set) goes: $1,2,1,2,1,1,2.$ So, for every $7$ sets after the first, there are three sets with $2$ multiples of $7$ . We calculate $\left\lfloor\frac{100-1}{7}\right\rfloor$ and multiply that by $3$ . (We also disregard the remainder of $1$ since it doesn't add any extra sets with $2$ multiples of $7$ .). We get $14\cdot3= \boxed{\textbf{(B) }42}$ .

## Solution 4 (Fastest)
Each set contains exactly $1$ or $2$ multiples of $7$ (Because it will need at least $2$ * $7$ = $14$ numbers in a group for $3$ or more multiples of $7$ ).
There are $\dfrac{1000}{10}=100$ total sets and $\left\lfloor\dfrac{1000}{7}\right\rfloor = 142$ multiples of $7$ . Thus, there are $142-100=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }42}$ sets with $2$ multiples of $7$ .

## Solution 5 (Simple Counting, Similar to Solution 1)
Consecutive multiples of $7$ must differ by $7$ . So, if a set $\{\ldots1,\ldots2,\ldots3,(\ldots),\ldots8,\ldots9,\ldots0\}$ contains two multiples of $7$ , they must end with the digits $1$ and $8$ , $2$ and $9$ , or $3$ and $0$ . This reduces the problem to counting the amount of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ that end with $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ .
The first multiple of $7$ that ends with $1$ is $21$ . The next multiple that ends with $1$ occurs $70$ later, since that is the smallest multiple of $7$ we can add to $21$ without affecting the last digit. The greatest number of $70$ 's we can add to $21$ while keeping it less than $1000$ is $13$ , because $21 + 70(13) = 931$ . Therefore, the set of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ ending with $1$ is $\{21 + 70(0), 21+70(1),\ldots,21+70(13)\}$ , meaning there are $14$ of these particular multiples. We can use the same reasoning to count the multiples of $7$ that end with $2$ and $3$ .
The first multiple of $7$ that ends with $2$ is $42$ . The greatest number of $70$ 's we can add to $42$ here is also $13$ , since $42 + 70(13) = 952$ . The set of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ ending with $2$ is $\{42 + 70(0), 42+70(1),\ldots,42+70(13)\}$ , giving $14$ multiples.
The first multiple of $7$ that ends with $3$ is $63$ . The greatest number of $70$ 's we can add to $63$ here is yet again $13$ , since $63 + 70(13) = 973$ . The set of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ ending with $3$ is $\{63 + 70(0), 63+70(1),\ldots,63+70(13)\}$ , giving another $14$ multiples.
In total, there are $14 + 14 + 14 = 42$ of these multiples, and so $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }42}$ sets with two multiples of $7$ .

## Solution 6 (Very Fast System of Equations)
Let $a$ be the number of sets with $1$ multiple of $7$ and $b$ be the number of sets with $2$ multiples of $7$ . Note that it is impossible for a set to have more than two multiples of $7$ .
Since there are a total of $100$ sets, $a+b=100$ . Also, since there are $\lfloor \frac{1000}{7}\rfloor = 142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$ , we must have $a+2b=142$ .
Solving the system of equations
\[a+b=100\] \[a+2b=142\]
for $b$ gives us the answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }42}$ .

## Solution 7 (reasonable count)
(Similar to Solution 3, but a little more intuitive and less numbers.) Note that this system loops every cycle of length $70$ , or $7$ such sets. From $1$ to $70$ , the multiples of $7$ are $7$ , $14$ , $21$ , $28$ , $35$ , $42$ , $49$ , $56$ , $63$ , and $70$ ; note that $(21,28),(42,49),$ and $(63,70)$ are in the same sets. Thus, for every $7$ sets, we have $3$ sets with exactly two multiples of $7$ . We have $100$ sets, which is $98+2=7\cdot14+2$ ; the first $98$ sets contain $\dfrac37(7\cdot14)=42$ desired sets. The last two sets comprise the integers from $981$ to $999$ ; the multiples of $7$ here are $987$ and $994$ . Neither of the two last sets contains two multiples of $7$ , so our answer is simply $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }42}$ .
