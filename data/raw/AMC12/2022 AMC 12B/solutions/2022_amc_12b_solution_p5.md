## Problem

The point $(-1, -2)$ is rotated $270^{\circ}$ counterclockwise about the point $(3, 1)$ . What are the coordinates of its new position?

$\textbf{(A)}\ (-3, -4) \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ (0,5) \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ (2,-1) \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ (4,3) \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ (6,-3)$

## Solution 1 (Cartesian Plane)
$(-1,-2)$ is $4$ units west and $3$ units south of $(3,1)$ . Performing a counterclockwise rotation of $270^{\circ}$ , which is equivalent to a clockwise rotation of $90^{\circ}$ , the answer is $3$ units west and $4$ units north of $(3,1)$ , or $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ (0,5)}$ .

## Solution 2 (Complex Numbers)
We write $(-1, -2)$ as $-1-2i.$ We'd like to rotate about $(3, 1),$ which is $3+i$ in the complex plane, by an angle of $270^{\circ} = \frac{3\pi}{2} \text{ rad}$ counterclockwise.
The formula for rotating the complex number $z$ about the complex number $w$ by an angle of $\theta$ counterclockwise is given as $(z-w)e^{\theta i} + w.$ Plugging in our values $z = -1-2i, w = 3+i, \theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}$ , we evaluate the expression as $((-1-2i) - (3+i))e^{\frac{3\pi i}{2}} + (3+i) = (-4-3i)(-i) + (3+i) = 4i-3i^2+3+i = 4i-3+3+i = 5i,$ which corresponds to $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ (0,5)}$ on the Cartesian plane.
