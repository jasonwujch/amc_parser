## Solution 1
Let the center of the hexagon be $O$ . $\triangle AOB$ , $\triangle BOC$ , $\triangle COD$ , $\triangle DOE$ , $\triangle EOF$ , and $\triangle FOA$ are all equilateral triangles with side length $2$ . Thus, $CO = 2$ , and $GO = \sqrt{AO^2 - AG^2} = \sqrt{3}$ . By symmetry, $\angle COG = 90^{\circ}$ . Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, $CG = \sqrt{2^2 + \sqrt{3}^2} = \sqrt{7}$ . Because $CO = OF$ and $GO = OH$ , $CG = HC = FH = GF = \sqrt{7}$ . Thus, the solution to our problem is $\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7} = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4\sqrt7}$ .

## Solution 2
Consider triangle $AFG$ . Note that $AF = 2$ , $AG = 1$ , and $\angle GAF = 120 ^{\circ}$ because it is an interior angle of a regular hexagon. (See note for details.)
By the Law of Cosines , we have: \begin{align*} FG^2 &= AG^2 + AF^2 - 2 \cdot AG \cdot AF \cdot \cos \angle GAF \\ FG^2 &= 1^2 + 2^2 - 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cos 120 ^{\circ} \\ FG^2 &= 5 + 4 \cdot \left( \frac 12 \right) \\ FG^2 &= 7 \\ FG &= \sqrt 7. \end{align*} By SAS Congruence , triangles $AFG$ , $BCG$ , $CDH$ , and $EFH$ are congruent, and by CPCTC , quadrilateral $GCHF$ is a rhombus. Therefore, the perimeter of $GCHF$ is $4 \cdot FG = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4\sqrt7}$ .
Note: The sum of the interior angles of any polygon with $n$ sides is given by $180 ^{\circ} (n - 2)$ . Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $720 ^{\circ}$ , and each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures $\frac{720 ^{\circ}}{6} = 120 ^{\circ}$ .

## Solution 3
We use a coordinates approach. Letting the origin be the center of the hexagon, we can let $A = (-1, \sqrt{3}), B = (1, \sqrt{3}), C = (2, 0), D = (1, -\sqrt{3}), E = (-1, -\sqrt{3}), F = (-2, 0).$ Then, $G = (0, \sqrt{3})$ and $H = (0, -\sqrt{3}).$
We use the distance formula four times to get $CH, HF, FG, \text{ and } GC.$ \begin{alignat*}{8} CH^2 &= (2-0)^2 + (0-(-\sqrt{3}))^2 &&= 7 &&\rightarrow CH &&= \sqrt{7}, \\ HF^2 &= (0-(-2))^2 + (-\sqrt{3}-0)^2 &&= 7 &&\rightarrow HF &&= \sqrt{7}, \\ FG^2 &= (-2-0)^2 + (0-\sqrt{3})^2 &&= 7 &&\rightarrow FG &&= \sqrt{7}, \\ GC^2 &= (0-2)^2 + (\sqrt{3}-0)^2 &&= 7 &&\rightarrow GC &&= \sqrt{7}. \end{alignat*} Thus, the perimeter of $GCHF = CH + HF + FG + GC = \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7} = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4\sqrt7}$ .

Note: the last part of this solution could have been simplified by noting that $CH = HF = FG = GC = \sqrt{7}.$

## Solution 4
Note that triangles $\triangle{GAF}, \triangle{FEH}, \triangle{HDC},$ and $\triangle{CBG}$ are all congruent, since they have side lengths of $1$ and $2$ and an included angle of $120^{\circ}.$
By the Law of Cosines, \[FG=\sqrt{1^2+2^2-2\cdot{1}\cdot{-\frac{1}{2}}}=\sqrt{7}.\] Therefore, $FG+GC+CH+HF=4\cdot{FG}=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4\sqrt7}.$

## Solution 5 (Answer Choices + Pythagorean Theorem Extension)
Like the previous solutions, note that $\triangle{GAF}, \triangle{FEH}, \triangle{HDC},$ and $\triangle{CBG}$ are all congruent by SAS. It follows that quadrilateral $GCHF$ is a rhombus.
Recall the Pythagorean Theorem, which states $a^2+b^2=c^2$ for all right triangles, where $c$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle. However, by drawing a quick diagram of an obtuse triangle, we can see that $a^2+b^2<c^2$ , in any given obtuse triangle.
Since $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon, all of its angles are obtuse. It follows that $\triangle{GAF}$ is an obtuse triangle. Using the extended Pythagorean Theorem for obtuse triangles, we have: \[AG^2+AF^2<GF^2 \implies 1^2+2^2<GF^2 \implies \sqrt{5}<GF\]
Since $GCHF$ is a rhombus, the perimeter is $4GF$ . This eliminates all answer choices but $D$ and $E$ , since in all of those options $GF<\sqrt{5}$ . Lastly, $E$ is eliminated due to the triangle inequality, as $1+2$ is not greater than $12/4=3$ .
Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4\sqrt7}$ .
