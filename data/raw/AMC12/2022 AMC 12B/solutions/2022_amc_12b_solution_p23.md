# 2022 AMC 12B Problem 23

## Problem

Let $x_0,x_1,x_2,\dotsc$ be a sequence of numbers, where each $x_k$ is either $0$ or $1$ . For each positive integer $n$ , define \[S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k 2^k\] Suppose $7S_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n}$ for all $n \geq 1$ . What is the value of the sum \[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}?\] $\textbf{(A) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 7 \qquad \textbf{(C) }12\qquad \textbf{(D) } 14\qquad \textbf{(E) }15$

## Solution 1
In binary numbers, we have \[S_n = (x_{n-1} x_{n-2} x_{n-3} x_{n-4} \ldots x_{2} x_{1} x_{0})_2.\] It follows that \[8S_n = (x_{n-1} x_{n-2} x_{n-3} x_{n-4} \ldots x_{2} x_{1} x_{0}000)_2.\] We obtain $7S_n$ by subtracting the equations: \[\begin{array}{clccrccccccr} & (x_{n-1} & x_{n-2} & x_{n-3} & x_{n-4} & \ldots & x_2 & x_1 & x_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \ )_2 \\ -\quad & & & & (x_{n-1} & \ldots & x_5 & x_4 & x_3 & x_2 & x_1 & x_0)_2 \\ \hline & & & & & & & & & & & \\ [-2.5ex] & ( \ \ ?& ? & ? & 0 \ \ \ & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \ )_2 \\ \end{array}\] We work from right to left: \begin{alignat*}{6} x_0=x_1=x_2=1 \quad &\implies \quad &x_3 &= 0& \\ \quad &\implies \quad &x_4 &= 1& \\ \quad &\implies \quad &x_5 &= 1& \\ \quad &\implies \quad &x_6 &= 0& \\ \quad &\implies \quad &x_7 &= 1& \\ \quad &\implies \quad &x_8 &= 1& \\ \quad &\quad \vdots & & & \end{alignat*} For all $n\geq3,$ we conclude that
- $x_n=0$ if and only if $n\equiv 0\pmod{3}.$
- $x_n=1$ if and only if $n\not\equiv 0\pmod{3}.$
Finally, we get $(x_{2019},x_{2020},x_{2021},x_{2022})=(0,1,1,0),$ from which \[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 6}.\] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)

## Solution 2
First, notice that \[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = \frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\] Then since $S_n$ is the modular inverse of $7$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^n}$ , we can perform the Euclidean Algorithm to find it for $n = 2019,2023$ .
Starting with $2019$ , \begin{align*} 7S_{2019} &\equiv 1 \pmod{2^{2019}} \\ 7S_{2019} &= 2^{2019}k + 1. \end{align*} Now, take both sides $\operatorname{mod} \ 7$ : \[0 \equiv 2^{2019}k + 1 \pmod{7}.\] Using Fermat's Little Theorem, \[2^{2019} = (2^{336})^6 \cdot 2^3 \equiv 2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.\] Thus, \[0 \equiv k + 1 \pmod{7} \implies k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \implies k = 7j + 6.\] Therefore, \[7S_{2019} = 2^{2019} (7j + 6) + 1 \implies S_{2019} = \frac{2^{2019} (7j + 6) + 1}{7}.\]
We may repeat this same calculation with $S_{2023}$ to yield \[S_{2023} = \frac{2^{2023} (7h + 3) + 1}{7}.\] Now, we notice that $S_n$ is basically an integer expressed in binary form with $n$ bits. This gives rise to a simple inequality, \[0 \leqslant S_n \leqslant 2^n.\] Since the maximum possible number that can be generated with $n$ bits is \[\underbrace{{11111\dotsc1}_2}_{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = 2^n - 1 \leqslant 2^n.\] Looking at our calculations for $S_{2019}$ and $S_{2023}$ , we see that the only valid integers that satisfy that constraint are $j = h = 0$ . \[\frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}} = \frac{\tfrac{2^{2023} \cdot 3 + 1}{7} - \tfrac{2^{2019} \cdot 6 + 1}{7}}{2^{2019}} = \frac{2^4 \cdot 3 - 6}{7} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 6}.\] ~zoomanTV

## Solution 3
As in Solution 2, we note that \[x_{2019}+2x_{2020}+4x_{2021}+8x_{2022}=\frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\] We also know that $7S_{2023} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{2023}}$ and $7S_{2019} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{2019}}$ , this implies: \[\textbf{(1) } 7S_{2023}=2^{2023}\cdot{x} + 1,\] \[\textbf{(2) } 7S_{2019}=2^{2019}\cdot{y} + 1.\] Dividing by $7$ , we can isolate the previous sums: \[\textbf{(3) } S_{2023}=\frac{2^{2023}\cdot{x} + 1}{7},\] \[\textbf{(4) } S_{2019}=\frac{2^{2019}\cdot{y} + 1}{7}.\] The maximum value of $S_n$ occurs when every $x_i$ is equal to $1$ . Even when this happens, the value of $S_n$ is less than $2^n$ . Therefore, we can construct the following inequalities: \[\textbf{(3) } S_{2023}=\frac{2^{2023}\cdot{x} + 1}{7} < 2^{2023},\] \[\textbf{(4) } S_{2019}=\frac{2^{2019}\cdot{y} + 1}{7} < 2^{2019}.\] From these two equations, we can deduce that both $x$ and $y$ are less than $7$ .
Reducing $\textbf{1}$ and $\textbf{2}$ $\pmod{7},$ we see that \[2^{2023}\cdot{x}\equiv 6\pmod{7},\] and \[2^{2019}\cdot{y}\equiv 6\pmod{7}.\]
The powers of $2$ repeat every $3, \pmod{7}.$
Therefore, $2^{2023}\equiv 2 \pmod 7$ and $2^{2019} \equiv 1 \pmod {7}.$ Substituing this back into the above equations, \[2x\equiv{6}\pmod{7}\] and \[y\equiv{6}\pmod{7}.\]
Since $x$ and $y$ are integers less than $7$ , the only values of $x$ and $y$ are $3$ and $6$ respectively.
The requested sum is \begin{align*} \frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}} &= \frac{\frac{2^{2023}\cdot{x} + 1}{7} - \frac{2^{2019}\cdot{y} + 1}{7}}{2^{2019}} \\ &= \frac{1}{2^{2019}}\left(\frac{2^{2023}\cdot{3} + 1}{7} -\left(\frac{2^{2019}\cdot{6} + 1}{7} \right)\right) \\ &= \frac{3\cdot{2^4}-6}{7} \\ &= \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 6}. \end{align*} -Benedict T (countmath1)

## Solution 4
Note that, as in Solution 2, we have \[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = \frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\] This is because \[S_{2023} = x_{0}2^{0} + x_{1}2^{1} + \cdots + x_{2019}2^{2019} + \cdots + x_{2022}2^{2022}\] and \[S_{2019} = x_{0}2^{0} + x_{1}2^{1} + \cdots + x_{2018}2^{2018}.\] Note that \[S_{2023} - S_{2019} = x_{2019}2^{2019} + \cdots + x_{2022}2^{2022} = 2^{2019}(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}).\] Therefore, \[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = \frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\] Multiplying both sides by 7 gives us \[7(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}) = \frac{7S_{2023} - 7S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\] We can write \[7S_{2023} = 1\pmod{2^{2023}} = 1 + 2^{2023}a = 1 + 2^{2019}*16a\] and \[7S_{2019} = 1\pmod{2^{2019}} = 1 + 2^{2019}b\] for some a and b. Substituting, we get \[7(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}) = \frac{(1 + 2^{2019} * 16a) - (1 + 2^{2019}b)}{2^{2019}} = 16a - b.\] Therefore, our answer can be written as \[\frac{16a - b}{7}.\] Another thing to notice is that a and b are integers between 0 and 6. This is because \[7(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \cdots + 2^{2022}) \geqslant 7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a\] which is \[7(2^{2023}) - 7 \geqslant 1 + 2^{2023}a\] \[(7-a) \geqslant \frac{8}{2^{2023}}\] which only holds when a is less than 7 because the right is very small positive number, so the left must be positive, too. Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, \[7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0\] which would mean \[S_{2023} < 0\] which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0. A similar explanation for b shows that b is an integer between 0 and 6 inclusive.
Going back to the solution, if our answer to the problem is n, then \[16a - b = 7n\] and \[16a = 7n + b,\] so we can try the five option choices and see which one, when multiplied by 7 and added to some whole number between 0 and 6 results in a multiple of 16. Trying all the option choices, we see that you need to add 7n to something more than 6 to equal a multiple of 16 other than for option A. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 6}.$

## Solution 5
Given that $7S_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n}$ , we have \begin{align*} 7S_n &= a_n2^n + 1\\ 7S_{n-1} &= a_{n-1}2^{n-1} + 1. \end{align*} where $a_n$ is integer.
Notice that \[S_n = S_{n-1} + 2^{n-1}x_{n-1}.\] Thus, \begin{align*} 7(S_n - S_{n-1}) &= 2^{n-1}(2a_n - a_{n-1})\\ 7 \cdot 2^{n - 1}x_{n - 1} &= 2^{n - 1}(2a_n - a_{n - 1})\\ 7x_{n-1} &= 2a_n - a_{n-1}. \end{align*} Obviously, $x_0 = 1$ , $S_1 = 1$ , $7S_1 = 3 \times 2^1 + 1$ , so $a_1 = 3$ . For each $i$ , $x_i$ must be 0 or 1, and $a_i$ is an integer, so we can repeat the recursion to yield \begin{align*} x_1 = \frac{2a_2 - a_1}{7} = \frac{2a_2 - 3}{7}\text{ can only be 1, where }a_2 = 5\\ x_2 = \frac{2a_3 - a_2}{7} = \frac{2a_3 - 5}{7}\text{ can only be 1, where }a_3 = 6\\ x_3 = \frac{2a_4 - a_3}{7} = \frac{2a_4 - 6}{7}\text{ can only be 0, where }a_4 = 3\\ x_4 = \frac{2a_5 - a_4}{7} = \frac{2a_5 - 3}{7}\text{ can only be 1, where }a_5 = 5\\ x_5 = \frac{2a_6 - a_5}{7} = \frac{2a_6 - 5}{7}\text{ can only be 1, where }a_6 = 6\\ x_6 = \frac{2a_7 - a_6}{7} = \frac{2a_7 - 6}{7}\text{ can only be 0, where }a_7 = 3 \end{align*} So for any non-negative integer $k$ , we can find that $x_{3k + 1} = 1$ , $x_{3k + 2} = 1$ , $x_{3k + 3} = 0$ , \[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = 0 + 2 \times 1 + 4 \times 1 + 8 \times 0 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 6}.\]

## Solution 6
Using the given conditions, it is evident that $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}=\frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}=a$ (for simplicity). Moreover, because $7S_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n}$ is true, an impulse to multiply the numerator and denominator by 7 is created. Let $7S_{2023}=2^{2023}k+1$ and $7S_{2019}=2^{2019}k'+1$ . \begin{align*} a=\frac{7S_{2023}-7S_{2019}}{7\cdot2^{2019}}&=\frac{2^{2023}k+1-2^{2019}k'-1}{7\cdot2^{2019}} \\ &=\frac{2^4k-k'}{7} \\ &=\frac{16k-k'}{7} \\ \end{align*} Furthermore, because $0\le x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\le15$ , $0\le\frac{16k-k'}{7}\le15$ . The order pairs $(k,k',a)$ could be found through trial and error that satisfies conditions $7S_{2023}=2^{2023}k+1$ and $7S_{2019}=2^{2019}k'+1$ . It is evident that $k\ne0,1,2$ using Euler's Theorem.
$(3,6,6)$ is valid because $7|2^{2023}\cdot3+1$ and $7|2^{2019}\cdot6$ . Thereby, $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 6}$ .

## Solution 7 (Very Fast but Still Rigorous)
$7=2^3-1 | 2^{2022}-1$ since $3|2022$ , so $2^{2022} \equiv 1 \pmod 7$ , with \[2^{2022}-1 = 7 (2^{2019} + 2^ {2016} + \dots +1).\] $6 \cdot 2^{2022} +1$ thus is a multiple of $7$ , so it is thus $7 \cdot S_n$ . We have \[6 \cdot 2^{2022} +1 = (2^2+2^1) (7 (2^{2019} + 2^ {2016} + \dots +1) +1) +1 = 7 ((2^2+2^1)(2^{2019} + 2^ {2016} + \dots +1) +1) = 7 (2^{2021}+ 2^{2020} + 2^{2018}+2^{2017}+\dots),\] so $x_{2022}=0,x_{2021}=1, x_{2020}=1, x_{2019}=0 \implies x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 6}$ .
