## Problem

For a science project, Sammy observed a chipmunk and squirrel stashing acorns in holes. The chipmunk hid 3 acorns in each of the holes it dug. The squirrel hid 4 acorns in each of the holes it dug. They each hid the same number of acorns, although the squirrel needed 4 fewer holes. How many acorns did the chipmunk hide?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 42\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 48\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 54$

## Solution
If $x$ is the number of holes that the chipmunk dug, then $3x=4(x-4)$ , so $3x=4x-16$ , and $x=16$ . The number of acorns hidden by the chipmunk is equal to $3x = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 48}$

## Solution 2
Trying answer choices, we see that $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 48}$ works. ~Extremelysupercooldude
