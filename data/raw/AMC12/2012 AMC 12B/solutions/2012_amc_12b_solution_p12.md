## Problem

How many sequences of zeros and ones of length 20 have all the zeros consecutive, or all the ones consecutive, or both?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 190\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 192\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 211\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 380\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 382$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
There are $\binom{20}{2}$ selections; however, we count these twice, therefore
$2\cdot\binom{20}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 380}$ . The wording of the question implies D, not E.
However, MAA decided to accept both D and E and F.

## Solution 2
Consider the 20 term sequence of $0$ 's and $1$ 's. Keeping all other terms 1, a sequence of $k>0$ consecutive 0's can be placed in $21-k$ locations. That is, there are 20 strings with 1 zero, 19 strings with 2 consecutive zeros, 18 strings with 3 consecutive zeros, ..., 1 string with 20 consecutive zeros. Hence there are $20+19+\cdots+1=\binom{21}{2}$ strings with consecutive zeros. The same argument shows there are $\binom{21}{2}$ strings with consecutive 1's. This yields $2\binom{21}{2}$ strings in all. However, we have counted twice those strings in which all the 1's and all the 0's are consecutive. These are the cases $01111...$ , $00111...$ , $000111...$ , ..., $000...0001$ (of which there are 19) as well as the cases $10000...$ , $11000...$ , $111000...$ , ..., $111...110$ (of which there are 19 as well). This yields $2\binom{21}{2}-2\cdot19=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 382}$

## Solution 3
First, we think of ways to make all the $1$ 's consecutive. If there are no consecutive $1$ 's, there are $\binom{20}{0}$ ways to order them. If there is one consecutive $1$ , there are $\binom{20}{1}$ ways to order them. If there are two consecutive $1$ 's, then there are $\binom{19}{1}$ ways to order them (We treat the two $1$ 's like a block, and then order that block with 18 other $0$ 's). Continuing in this fashion, there are $\binom{20}{0} + \binom{20}{1} + \binom{19}{1} + \cdots + \binom{1}{1} = 1 + 20 + 19 + \cdots + 2 + 1 = 210 + 1 = 211$ ways to order consecutive $1$ 's. From symmetry, there are also $211$ ways to order the $0$ 's. Now, from PIE, we subtract out the cases where both the $1$ 's and the $0$ 's are consecutive. We do this because when counting the ways to order the $1$ 's, we counted all of these cases once. Then, we did so again when ordering the $0$ 's. So, to only have all of these cases once, we must subtract them. If $1$ is the leftmost digit, then there are $20$ cases where all the $1$ 's and $0$ 's are consecutive (we basically are choosing how many $1$ 's are consecutive, and there are $20$ possibilities. All other digits become $0$ , which are automatically consecutive since the $1$ 's are consecutive. There are also $20$ cases when $0$ is the left-most digit. Thus, there are a total of $211 + 211 - 20 - 20 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 382}$ . But, from the way the problem is worded, it somewhat implies that the orderings must include both $1$ 's and $0$ 's, so the answer would then be $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 380}$ after we subtract out the cases where the orderings are either all $1$ 's or all $0$ 's. But, since this is unclear, MAA accepted both $\boxed{\textbf{(D}\ 380}$ and $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 382}$ as acceptable answers.

## Solution 4
We consider two cases, and subtract their overcount.
Case $1$ : Consecutive $0$ s
If we have one consecutive $0$ , then we have $20$ ways. If we have two consecutive $0$ s, then we have $19$ ways by thinking of the two consecutives as a block. Continuing this pattern, if we have twenty consecutive $0$ s, then we have only $1$ way.
Therefore, we have $20+19+\cdots+1=\binom{21}{2}$ ways for this case.
Case $2$ : Consecutive $1$ s
Notice that if we just swap every $0$ to a $1$ in the previous case, we also have a valid arrangement. Hence, we also have $20+19+\cdots+1=\binom{21}{2}$ ways for this case.
Overcount: Notice that we can have BOTH the $0$ s and the $1$ s be consecutive. These are the cases $01111...$ , $00111...$ , $000111...$ , ..., $000...0000$ which gives us $20$ ways being overcounted. If we invert the $0$ s to $1$ s, we similarly have $20$ more ways, hence we need to subtract $40$ from our total count. (Note: this method of overcounting subtracts out the all $0$ s and the all $1$ s case since the problem implies that there needs to be at least one of each)
So we have $210 + 210 - 40 = 380$ ways which gives us $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 380}$ .
