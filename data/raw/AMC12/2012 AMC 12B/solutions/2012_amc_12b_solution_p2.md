## Problem

A circle of radius 5 is inscribed in a rectangle as shown. The ratio of the length of the rectangle to its width is 2:1. What is the area of the rectangle?

[asy] draw((0,0)--(0,10)--(20,10)--(20,0)--cycle); draw(circle((10,5),5)); [/asy]

$\textbf{(A)}\ 50\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 100\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 125\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 150\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 200$

## Solution
If the radius is $5$ , then the width is $10$ , hence the length is $20$ . $10\times20= \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 200}.$
