# 2015 AMC 12B Problem 9

## Problem

Larry and Julius are playing a game, taking turns throwing a ball at a bottle sitting on a ledge. Larry throws first. The winner is the first person to knock the bottle off the ledge. At each turn the probability that a player knocks the bottle off the ledge is $\tfrac{1}{2}$ , independently of what has happened before. What is the probability that Larry wins the game?

$\textbf{(A)}\; \dfrac{1}{2} \qquad\textbf{(B)}\; \dfrac{3}{5} \qquad\textbf{(C)}\; \dfrac{2}{3} \qquad\textbf{(D)}\; \dfrac{3}{4} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\; \dfrac{4}{5}$

## Solution

## Solution 1
If Larry wins, he either wins on the first move, or the third move, or the fifth move, etc. Let $W$ represent "player wins", and $L$ represent "player loses". Then the events corresponding to Larry winning are $W, LLW, LLLLW, LLLLLLW, \ldots$
Thus the probability of Larry winning is
$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{2^5} + \frac{1}{2^7} + \cdots$
This is a geometric series with ratio $\frac{1}{2^2}=\frac{1}{4}$ , hence the answer is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; \frac{2}{3}}$ .

## Solution 2
Break the problem up into two separate cases: (a) Larry wins on the first throw or (b) Larry wins after the first throw.
a: The probability that Larry wins on the first throw is $\frac{1}{2}$ .
b: The probability that Larry wins after the first throw is half the probability that Julius wins because it only occurs half the time. This probability is $\frac{1}{2}(1-x)$ , where $x$ is the probability that Larry wins.
Therefore, $x = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(1 - x)$ . This equation can be solved for $x$ to find that the probability that Larry wins is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; \frac{2}{3}}$ .
