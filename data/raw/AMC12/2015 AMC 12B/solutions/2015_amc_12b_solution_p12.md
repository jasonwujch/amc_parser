## Problem

Let $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ be three distinct one-digit numbers. What is the maximum value of the sum of the roots of the equation $(x-a)(x-b)+(x-b)(x-c)=0$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\; 15 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\; 15.5 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\; 16 \qquad\textbf{(D)} 16.5 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\; 17$

## Solution 1
The left-hand side of the equation can be factored as $(x-b)(x-a+x-c) = (x-b)(2x-(a+c))$ , from which it follows that the roots of the equation are $x=b$ , and $x=\tfrac{a+c}{2}$ . The sum of the roots is therefore $b + \tfrac{a+c}{2}$ , and the maximum is achieved by choosing $b=9$ , and $\{a,c\}=\{7,8\}$ . Therefore the answer is $9 + \tfrac{7+8}{2} = 9 + 7.5 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\; 16.5}.$

## Solution 2
Expand the polynomial. We get $(x-a)(x-b)+(x-b)(x-c)=x^2-(a+b)x+ab+x^2-(b+c)x+bc=2x^2-(a+2b+c)x+(ab+bc).$
Now, consider a general quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0.$ The two solutions to this are \[\dfrac{-b}{2a}+\dfrac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}, \dfrac{-b}{2a}-\dfrac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\] The sum of these roots is \[\dfrac{-b}{a}.\]
Therefore, reconsidering the polynomial of the problem, the sum of the roots is \[\dfrac{a+2b+c}{2}.\] Now, to maximize this, it is clear that $b=9.$ Also, we must have $a=8, c=7$ (or vice versa). The reason $a,c$ have to equal these values instead of larger values is because each of $a,b,c$ is distinct.

## Solution 3 (Vieta's Formula)
Expanding gives: $2x^2-(a+2b+c)x+(ab+bc).$
Dividing by the coefficient of the polynomial, 2, and applying Vieta's formulas we know that the sum of the roots of the polynomial is equal to $\frac{a + 2b + c}{2}$ . Obviously, the largest value should occur when b = 9, and due to symmetrically a = 8, and c = 7, or a = 7 and c = 8. Both of these results give the same final answer of (D).
