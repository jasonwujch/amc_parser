## Problem

An unfair coin lands on heads with a probability of $\tfrac{1}{4}$ . When tossed $n>1$ times, the probability of exactly two heads is the same as the probability of exactly three heads. What is the value of $n$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\; 5 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\; 8 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\; 10 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\; 11 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\; 13$

## Solution
When tossed $n$ times, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and the rest tails is
\[\dbinom{n}{2} {\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^2 {\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) }^{n-2}.\]
Similarly, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads is
\[\dbinom{n}{3}{\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^3 {\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) }^{n-3}.\]
Now set the two probabilities equal to each other and solve for $n$ :
\[\dbinom{n}{2}{\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^2 {\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) }^{n-2}=\dbinom{n}{3}{\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^3 {\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) }^{n-3}\]
\[\frac{n(n-1)}{2!} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!} \cdot \frac{1}{4}\]
\[3 = \frac{n-2}{3}\]
\[n-2 = 9\]
\[n = \fbox{\textbf{(D)}\; 11}\]
Note: the original problem did not specify $n>1$ , so $n=1$ was a solution, but this was fixed in the Wiki problem text so that the answer would make sense. — @adihaya ( talk ) 15:23, 19 February 2016 (EST)

## Solution 2
Bash it out with the answer choices! (not really a rigorous solution)

## Solution 2.5
In order to test the answer choices efficiently, realize that the probability $n$ flips yielding two heads is of the form:
$\dbinom{n}{2}{\left(\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4}\right)}{\left(\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \ldots \right)} = \dbinom{n}{2}{\left(\frac{3^{n-2}}{4^n}\right)}$
Similarly, the form for the probability of three heads is:
$\dbinom{n}{3}{\left(\frac{3^{n-3}}{4^n}\right)}$
The probability of getting three heads (comapred to the probability of getting two) from $n$ flips is missing a factor of $3$ in the numerator. Thus, we need $\dbinom{n}{3}$ to add a factor of $3$ to the numerator of the probability of getting three heads. Our testing equation becomes
\[\dbinom{n}{2} \times 3 = \dbinom{n}{3}\]
since after factoring out the $3$ from $\dbinom{n}{3}$ , the remaining factorizations should be equal.
The only answer choice satisfying this condition is $\fbox{\textbf{(D)}\;11}$ .
