## Problem

The sum of two nonzero real numbers is 4 times their product. What is the sum of the reciprocals of the two numbers?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 12$

## Solution
Let $x, y$ be our two numbers. Then $x+y = 4xy$ . Thus,
$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{x+y}{xy} = 4$ .
$\boxed{ \textbf{C}}$ .

## Solution 2
We can let $x=y.$ Then, we have that $2x=4x^2$ making $x=\tfrac{1}{2}.$ The answer is $\dfrac{2}{x}=4=\boxed{ \textbf{C}}.$ ~ Solasky ( talk )
