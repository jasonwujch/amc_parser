# 2017 AMC 12A Problem 5

## Problem

At a gathering of $30$ people, there are $20$ people who all know each other and $10$ people who know no one. People who know each other hug, and people who do not know each other shake hands. How many handshakes occur?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 240\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 245\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 290\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 480\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 490$

## Solution 1 (Basic)
All of the handshakes will involve at least one person from the $10$ who knows no one. Label these ten people $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ , $E$ , $F$ , $G$ , $H$ , $I$ , $J$ .
Person $A$ from the group of $10$ will initiate a handshake with everyone else ( $29$ people). Person $B$ initiates $28$ handshakes plus the one already counted from person $A$ . Person $C$ initiates $27$ new handshakes plus the two we already counted. This continues until person $J$ initiates $20$ handshakes plus the nine we already counted from $A$ ... $I$ .
$29+28+27+26+25+24+23+22+21+20 = \boxed{(B)=\ 245}$

## Solution 2
Let the group of people who all know each other be $A$ , and let the group of people who know no one be $B$ . Handshakes occur between each pair $(a,b)$ such that $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ , and between each pair of members in $B$ . Thus, the answer is
$|A||B|+{|B|\choose 2} = 20\cdot 10+{10\choose 2} = 200+45 = \boxed{(B)=\ 245}$

## Solution 3 (Complementary Counting)
The number of handshakes will be equivalent to the difference between the number of total interactions and the number of hugs, which are ${30\choose 2}$ and ${20\choose 2}$ , respectively. Thus, the total amount of handshakes is ${30\choose 2} - {20\choose 2} = 435 - 190= \boxed{(B)=\ 245}$

## Solution 4
Each of the $10$ people who do not know anybody will shake hands with all $20$ of the people who do know each other. This means there will be at least $20 * 10 = 200$ handshakes. In addition, those $10$ people will also shake hands with each other, giving us another $9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 45$ handshakes. Therefore, there is a total of $200+45 = \boxed{(B) = 245}$ handshakes.

## Solution 5
Every one of the $20$ people who know each other will shake hands with each of the $10$ people who know no one, so there are $20\cdot 10 = 200$ handshakes here. Each of the $10$ people will also shake hands with each other, so there will be ${10 \choose 2}$ $=45$ handshakes for this case. In total, there are $200+45 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 245}$ handshakes.
