# 2017 AMC 12A Problem 3

## Problem

Ms. Carroll promised that anyone who got all the multiple choice questions right on the upcoming exam would receive an A on the exam. Which one of these statements necessarily follows logically?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{ If Lewis did not receive an A, then he got all of the multiple choice questions wrong.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \text{ If Lewis did not receive an A, then he got at least one of the multiple choice questions wrong.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \text{ If Lewis got at least one of the multiple choice questions wrong, then he did not receive an A.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \text{ If Lewis received an A, then he got all of the multiple choice questions right.} \\ \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \text{ If Lewis received an A, then he got at least one of the multiple choice questions right.}$

## Solution
Taking the contrapositive of the statement "if he got all of them right, he got an A" yields "if he didn't get an A, he didn't get all of them right", yielding the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$ .
