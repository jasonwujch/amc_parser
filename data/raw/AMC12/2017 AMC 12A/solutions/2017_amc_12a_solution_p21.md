# 2017 AMC 12A Problem 21

## Problem

A set $S$ is constructed as follows. To begin, $S = \{0,10\}$ . Repeatedly, as long as possible, if $x$ is an integer root of some polynomial $a_{n}x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{1}x + a_0$ for some $n\geq{1}$ , all of whose coefficients $a_i$ are elements of $S$ , then $x$ is put into $S$ . When no more elements can be added to $S$ , how many elements does $S$ have?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 5 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 7 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 9 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 11$

## Solution
At first, $S=\{0,10\}$ .
\[\begin{tabular}{r c l c l} \(10x+10\) & has root & \(x=-1\) & so now & \(S=\{-1,0,10\}\) \\ \(-x^{10}-x^9-x^8-x^7-x^6-x^5-x^4-x^3-x^2-x+10\) & has root & \(x=1\) & so now & \(S=\{-1,0,1,10\}\) \\ \(x+10\) & has root & \(x=-10\) & so now & \(S=\{-10,-1,0,1,10\}\) \\ \(x^3+x-10\) & has root & \(x=2\) & so now & \(S=\{-10,-1,0,1,2,10\}\) \\ \(x+2\) & has root & \(x=-2\) & so now & \(S=\{-10,-2,-1,0,1,2,10\}\) \\ \(2x-10\) & has root & \(x=5\) & so now & \(S=\{-10,-2,-1,0,1,2,5,10\}\) \\ \(x+5\) & has root & \(x=-5\) & so now & \(S=\{-10,-5,-2,-1,0,1,2,5,10\}\) \end{tabular}\]
At this point, no more elements can be added to $S$ . To see this, let
\begin{align*} a_{n}x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_{2}x^2 + a_{1}x + a_0 &= 0 \\ x(a_{n}x^{n-1} + a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + ... + a_{2}x + a_{1}) + a_0 &= 0 \\ x(a_{n}x^{n-1} + a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + ... + a_{2}x + a_{1}) &= -a_0 \end{align*}
with each $a_i$ in $S$ . $x$ is a factor of $a_0$ , and $a_0$ is in $S$ , so $x$ has to be a factor of some element in $S$ . There are no such integers left, so there can be no additional elements. $\{-10,-5,-2,-1,0,1,2,5,10\}$ has $9$ elements $\to \boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$
