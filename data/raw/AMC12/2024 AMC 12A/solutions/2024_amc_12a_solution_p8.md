## Problem

How many angles $\theta$ with $0\le\theta\le2\pi$ satisfy $\log(\sin(3\theta))+\log(\cos(2\theta))=0$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }0 \qquad \textbf{(B) }1 \qquad \textbf{(C) }2 \qquad \textbf{(D) }3 \qquad \textbf{(E) }4 \qquad$

## Solution 1
Note that this is equivalent to $\sin(3\theta)\cos(2\theta)=1$ , which is clearly only possible when $\sin(3\theta)=\cos(2\theta)=\pm1$ . (If either one is between $1$ and $-1$ , the other one must be greater than $1$ or less than $-1$ to offset the product, which is impossible for sine and cosine.) They cannot be both $-1$ since we cannot take logarithms of negative numbers, so they are both $+1$ . Then $3\theta$ is $\dfrac\pi2$ more than a multiple of $2\pi$ and $2\theta$ is a multiple of $2\pi$ , so $\theta$ is $\dfrac\pi6$ more than a multiple of $\dfrac23\pi$ and also a multiple of $\pi$ . However, a multiple of $\dfrac23\pi$ will always have a denominator of $1$ or $3$ , and never $6$ ; it can thus never add with $\dfrac\pi6$ to form an integral multiple of $\pi$ . Thus, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0}$ solutions.

## Solution 1.1 (less words)
\[\log(\sin(3\theta))+\log(\cos(2\theta))=0\] \[\log(\sin(3\theta)\cos(2\theta))=0\] \[\sin(3\theta)\cos(2\theta)=1\] \[\text{Since } -1\le \sin(x),\cos(x)\le 1 \Rightarrow \sin(3\theta)=\cos(2\theta)= \pm1\] BUT note that $\log(-1)$ is not real \[\Rightarrow \sin(3\theta)=\cos(2\theta)= 1\] \[3\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}+2\pi n; \space 2\theta=2\pi m \space (m,n \in \mathbb{Z})\] \[\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}+\frac{2\pi n}{3}; \space \theta=\pi m\] \[\Rightarrow \theta\text { has no solution}\] Giving us $\fbox{(A) 0}$ .

## Solution 2
Let $f(\theta)=\log(\sin(3\theta))$ and let $g(\theta)=\log(\cos(2\theta))$ .
Note that $-1\leq\sin(3\theta),\cos(2\theta)\leq1$ . Because the logarithm of a nonpositive number is not real, the functions $f$ and $g$ only exist when $\sin(3\theta)$ and $\cos(2\theta)$ are positive, respectively. Furthermore, because the logarithm of any positive real number less than $1$ is negative, the only case where the function $f+g$ could equal $0$ is if $f(\theta)=g(\theta)=0$ , which only occurs when their respective sine and cosine expressions are both equal to $1$ .
Thus, we have these two equations, where $m$ and $n$ are any integers: \begin{align*} \sin(3\theta)=1 \Rightarrow 3\theta = \frac\pi2+2\pi m &\Rightarrow \theta = \frac\pi6+\frac{2\pi}3 m = \frac{4m+1}6\pi\\ \cos(2\theta)=1 \Rightarrow 2\theta = 2\pi n &\Rightarrow \theta = \pi n \end{align*}
Because $m$ is an integer, $4m+1$ is odd, and so $\frac{4m+1}6$ is never an integer. Therefore, by the first equation, $\theta$ can never be an integer multiple of pi. Thus, because the second equation requires that $\theta$ be an integer multiple of pi, these two equations cannot both be satisfied, and so there are no solutions to the given equation.
Thus, we choose answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0}$ .

## Solution 3 (solution 1.1 with graphing)
\[\log(\sin(3\theta))+\log(\cos(2\theta))=0\] \[\log(\sin(3\theta))=-\log(\cos(2\theta))=\log(\sec(2\theta))\] \[\therefore\text{let } y=\sin(3\theta)=\sec(2\theta), y > 0\] Sketching the graphs $y=\sin(3x)$ and $y=\sec(2x)$ for $y>0$ , we see there are no intersections.
Thus there are $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0}$ angles that work.
