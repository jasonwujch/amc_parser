# 2010 AMC 12B Problem 16

## Problem

Positive integers $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are randomly and independently selected with replacement from the set $\{1, 2, 3,\dots, 2010\}$ . What is the probability that $abc + ab + a$ is divisible by $3$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \dfrac{1}{3} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \dfrac{29}{81} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \dfrac{31}{81} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \dfrac{11}{27} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \dfrac{13}{27}$

## Solution 1
We group this into groups of $3$ , because $3|2010$ . This means that every residue class mod 3 has an equal probability.
If $3|a$ , we are done. There is a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ that that happens.
Otherwise, we have $3|bc+b+1$ , which means that $b(c+1) \equiv 2\pmod{3}$ . So either \[b \equiv 1 \pmod{3}, c \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\] or \[b \equiv 2 \pmod {3}, c \equiv 0 \pmod 3\] which will lead to the property being true. There is a $\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{9}$ chance for each bundle of cases to be true. Thus, the total for the cases is $\frac{2}{9}$ . But we have to multiply by $\frac{2}{3}$ because this only happens with a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance. So the total is actually $\frac{4}{27}$ .
The grand total is \[\frac{1}{3} + \frac{4}{27} = \boxed{\text{(E) }\frac{13}{27}.}\]

## Solution 2 (Minor change from Solution 1)
Just like solution 1, we see that there is a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance of $3|a$ and $\frac{2}{9}$ chance of $3|1+b+bc$
Now, we can just use PIE (Principles of Inclusion and Exclusion) to get our answer to be $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{9}-\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{9} = \boxed{\text{(E) } \frac{13}{27}}$

## Solution 3 (Fancier version of Solution 1)
As with solution one, we conclude that if $a\equiv0\mod 3$ then the requirements are satisfied. We then have: \[a(bc+c)+a\equiv0 \mod 3\] \[a(bc+c)\equiv-a \mod 3\] \[c(b+1)\equiv-1 \mod 3\] \[b+1\equiv \frac{-1}{c} \mod 3\] Which is true for one $b$ when $c\not\equiv 0 \mod 3$ because the integers $\mod 3$ form a field under multiplication and addition with absorbing element $0$ .
This gives us $P=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{4}{27}=\boxed{\text{(E) }\frac{13}{27}}$ .
