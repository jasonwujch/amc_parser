# 2010 AMC 12B Problem 3

## Problem

A ticket to a school play cost $x$ dollars, where $x$ is a whole number. A group of 9th graders buys tickets costing a total of \$ $48$ , and a group of 10th graders buys tickets costing a total of \$ $64$ . How many values for $x$ are possible?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution
We find the greatest common factor of $48$ and $64$ to be $16$ . The number of factors of $16$ is $5$ which is the answer $(E)$ .

## Solution 2
Since the price of one ticket is a whole number, it must be a divisor of both $48$ and $64$ . An integer is a common divisor of two numbers if and only if it is divisible by their difference. Hence, all the possible prices are positive divisors of $16$ , or $1$ , $2$ , $4$ , $8$ , and $16$ , making the answer $5$ , or E. - By Monkey_King
