# 2010 AMC 12B Problem 1

## Problem

Makarla attended two meetings during her $9$ -hour work day. The first meeting took $45$ minutes and the second meeting took twice as long. What percent of her work day was spent attending meetings?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 20 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 25 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 30 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 35$

## Solution
The total number of minutes in her $9$ -hour work day is $9 \times 60 = 540.$ The total amount of time spend in meetings in minutes is $45 + 45 \times 2 = 135.$ The answer is then $\frac{135}{540}$ $= \boxed{25\%}$ or $\boxed{(C)}$
