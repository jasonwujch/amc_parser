# 2010 AMC 12B Problem 10

## Problem

The average of the numbers $1, 2, 3,\cdots, 98, 99,$ and $x$ is $100x$ . What is $x$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \dfrac{49}{101} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \dfrac{50}{101} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \dfrac{1}{2} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \dfrac{51}{101} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \dfrac{50}{99}$

## Solution
We first sum the first $99$ numbers: $\frac{99(100)}{2}=99\cdot50$ . Then, we know that the sum of the series is $99\cdot50+x$ . There are $100$ terms, so we can divide this sum by $100$ and set it equal to $100x$ : \[\frac{99\cdot50+x}{100}=100x \Rightarrow 99\cdot50=100^2x-x\Rightarrow \frac{99\cdot50}{100^2-1}=x\] Using difference of squares: \[x=\frac{99\cdot50}{101\cdot99}=\frac{50}{101}\] Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{50}{101}}$ .
