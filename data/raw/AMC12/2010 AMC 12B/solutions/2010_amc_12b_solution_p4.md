# 2010 AMC 12B Problem 4

## Problem

A month with $31$ days has the same number of Mondays and Wednesdays. How many of the seven days of the week could be the first day of this month?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 5 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 6$

## Solution
$31 \equiv 3 \pmod {7}$ so the week cannot start with Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday or Wednesday as that would result in an unequal number of Mondays and Wednesdays. Therefore, Monday, Thursday, and Friday are valid so the answer is $\boxed{B}$ .
