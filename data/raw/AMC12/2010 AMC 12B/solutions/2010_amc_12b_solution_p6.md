# 2010 AMC 12B Problem 6

## Problem

At the beginning of the school year, $50\%$ of all students in Mr. Well's class answered "Yes" to the question "Do you love math", and $50\%$ answered "No." At the end of the school year, $70\%$ answered "Yes" and $30\%$ answered "No." Altogether, $x\%$ of the students gave a different answer at the beginning and end of the school year. What is the difference between the maximum and the minimum possible values of $x$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 0 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 20 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 40 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 60 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 80$

## Solution
The minimum possible value would be $70 - 50 = 20\%$ . The maximum possible value would be $30 + 50 = 80\%$ . The difference is $80 - 20 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }60}$ .
