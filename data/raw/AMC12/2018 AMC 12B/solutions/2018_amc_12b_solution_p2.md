# 2018 AMC 12B Problem 2

## Problem

Sam drove $96$ miles in $90$ minutes. His average speed during the first $30$ minutes was $60$ mph (miles per hour), and his average speed during the second $30$ minutes was $65$ mph. What was his average speed, in mph, during the last $30$ minutes?

$\textbf{(A) } 64 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 65 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 66 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 67 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 68$

## Solution 1
Suppose that Sam's average speed during the last $30$ minutes was $x$ mph.
Recall that a half hour is equal to $30$ minutes. Therefore, Sam drove $60\cdot0.5=30$ miles during the first half hour, $65\cdot0.5=32.5$ miles during the second half hour, and $x\cdot0.5$ miles during the last half hour. We have \begin{align*} 30+32.5+x\cdot0.5&=96 \\ x\cdot0.5&=33.5 \\ x&=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 67}. \end{align*} ~Haha0201 ~MRENTHUSIASM

## Solution 2
Suppose that Sam's average speed during the last $30$ minutes was $x$ mph.
Note that Sam's average speed during the entire trip was $\frac{96}{3/2}=64$ mph. Since Sam drove at $60$ mph, $65$ mph, and $x$ mph for the same duration ( $30$ minutes each), his average speed during the entire trip was the average of $60$ mph, $65$ mph, and $x$ mph. We have \begin{align*} \frac{60+65+x}{3}&=64 \\ 60+65+x&=192 \\ x&=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 67}. \end{align*} ~coolmath_2018 ~MRENTHUSIASM
