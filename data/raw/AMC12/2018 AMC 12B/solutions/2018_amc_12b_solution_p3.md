## Problem

A line with slope $2$ intersects a line with slope $6$ at the point $(40,30)$ . What is the distance between the $x$ -intercepts of these two lines?

$\textbf{(A) } 5 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 10 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 20 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 25 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 50$

## Solution 1
Using point slope form, we get the equations $y-30 = 6(x-40)$ and $y-30 = 2(x-40)$ . Simplifying, we get $6x-y=210$ and $2x-y=50$ . Letting $y=0$ in both equations and solving for $x$ gives the $x$ -intercepts: $x=35$ and $x=25$ , respectively. Thus the distance between them is $35-25=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 10}$ .

## Solution 2
In order for the line with slope $2$ to travel "up" $30$ units (from $y=0$ ), it must have traveled $30/2=15$ units to the right. Thus, the $x$ -intercept is at $x=40-15=25$ . As for the line with slope $6$ , in order for it to travel "up" $30$ units it must have traveled $30/6=5$ units to the right. Thus its $x$ -intercept is at $x=40-5=35$ . Then the distance between them is $35-25=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 10}$ .
