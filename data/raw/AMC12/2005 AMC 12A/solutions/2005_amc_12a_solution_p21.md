## Problem

How many ordered triples of integers $(a,b,c)$ , with $a \geq 2$ , $b \geq 1$ , and $c \geq 0$ , satisfy both $\log_{a}b = c^{2005}$ and $a + b + c = 2005$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)} \ 0 \qquad \mathrm{(B)} \ 1 \qquad \mathrm{(C)} \ 2 \qquad \mathrm{(D)} \ 3 \qquad \mathrm{(E)} \ 4$

## Solution
$a^{c^{2005}} = b$
Casework upon $c$ :
- $c = 0$ : Then $a^0 = b \Longrightarrow b = 1$ . Thus we get $(2004,1,0)$ .
- $c = 1$ : Then $a^1 = b \Longrightarrow a = b$ . Thus we get $(1002,1002,1)$ .
- $c \ge 2$ : Then the exponent of $a$ becomes huge, and since $a \ge 2$ there is no way we can satisfy the second condition. Hence we have two ordered triples $\mathrm{(C)}$ .
