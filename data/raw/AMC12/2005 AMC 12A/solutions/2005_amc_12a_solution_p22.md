# 2005 AMC 12A Problem 22

## Problem

A rectangular box $P$ is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$ . The surface area of $P$ is 384, and the sum of the lengths of its $12$ edges is $112$ . What is $r$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 8\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 10\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 12\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 14\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 16$

## Solution 1
Box P has dimensions $l$ , $w$ , and $h$ . Its surface area is \[2lw+2lh+2wh=384,\] and the sum of all its edges is \[l + w + h = \dfrac{4l+4w+4h}{4} = \dfrac{112}{4} = 28.\]
The diameter of the sphere is the space diagonal of the prism, which is \[\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 +h^2}.\] Notice that \begin{align*}(l + w + h)^2 - (2lw + 2lh + 2wh) &= l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \\ &= 784 - 384 \\ &= 400,\end{align*} so the diameter is \[\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 +h^2} = \sqrt{400} = 20.\] The radius is half of the diameter, so \[r=\frac{20}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 10}.\]

## Solution 2 (non-rigorous)
As in the previous solution, we have that $2lw+2lh+2wh=384$ and $l + w + h = \dfrac{4l+4w+4h}{4} = \dfrac{112}{4} = 28$ , and the diameter of the sphere is the space diagonal of the prism, $\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$ .
Now, since this is competition math, we only need to find the space diagonal of any one box that fits the requirements, so assume that $h=0$ . (This essentially means that we have an infinitesimally thin box.) We now have that $2lw = 384$ and $l + w = 28$ , and we are solving for $\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}$ . Because \begin{align*}(l + w)^2 - 2lw &= l^2 + 2lw + w^2 - 2lw \\ &= l^2 + w^2,\end{align*} this means that \[l^2 + w^2 = 28^2 - 384 = 400,\] so the space diagonal is $\sqrt{400} = 20$ . Since the diameter of the sphere is $20$ , the radius is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 10}$ . ~ emerald_block
