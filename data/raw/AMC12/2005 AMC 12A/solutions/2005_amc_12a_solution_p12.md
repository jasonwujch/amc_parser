## Problem

A line passes through $A(1,1)$ and $B(100,1000)$ . How many other points with integer coordinates are on the line and strictly between $A$ and $B$ ?

$(\mathrm {A}) \ 0 \qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ 2 \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ 3 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ 8 \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ 9$

## Solution
For convenience’s sake, we can transform $A$ to the origin and $B$ to $(99,999)$ (this does not change the problem). The line $AB$ has the equation $y = \frac{999}{99}x = \frac{111}{11}x$ . The coordinates are integers if $11|x$ , so the values of $x$ are $11, 22 \ldots 88$ , with a total of $8\implies \boxed{\mathrm{(D)}}$ coordinates.

## Solution 2
The slope of the line is $\frac{1000-1}{100-1}=\frac{111}{11},$ so all points on the line have the form $(1+11t, 1+111t)$ for some value of $t$ (the rise is 111 and the run is 11). Such a point has integer coordinates if and only if $t$ is an integer, and the point is strictly between $A$ and $B$ if and only if $0<t<9$ . Thus, there are $\boxed{8}$ points with the required property. -Paixiao

## Solution 3 (modular arithmetic)
We can re-write the equation in slope-intercept form (where y is on the left side). We know that the slope is $\frac{1000 - 1}{100 - 1} = \frac{999}{99} = \frac{111}{11}$ . Then, we have $y = \frac{111}{11}x - \frac{100}{11}$ which reduces to $y = \frac{111x - 100}{11}$ . Now, it remains to look for values of $x$ such that $111x \equiv 1 (\mod 11)$ . Since $111 \equiv 1 (\mod 11)$ , there are $\boxed{8 \textbf{(D)}}$ coordinates for which this is true. ~elpianista227
