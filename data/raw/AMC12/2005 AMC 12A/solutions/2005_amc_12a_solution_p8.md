# 2005 AMC 12A Problem 8

## Problem

Let $A,M$ , and $C$ be digits with

\[(100A+10M+C)(A+M+C) = 2005.\]

What is $A$ ?

$(\mathrm {A}) \ 1 \qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ 2 \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ 3 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ 4 \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ 5$

## Solution
Clearly the two quantities are both integers, so we check the prime factorization of $2005 = 5 \cdot 401$ . It is easy to see now that $(A,M,C) = (4,0,1)$ works, so the answer is $\mathrm{(D)}$ .
