# 2005 AMC 12A Problem 9

## Problem

There are two values of $a$ for which the equation $4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0$ has only one solution for $x$ . What is the sum of those values of $a$ ?

$(\mathrm {A}) \ -16 \qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ -8 \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ 0 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ 8 \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ 20$

## Solution 1 (Slowest)
We first rewrite $4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0$ as $4x^2 + (a+8)x + 9 = 0$ . Since there is only one root, the discriminant, $(a+8)^2-144$ , has to be 0. We solve the remaining as below: $(a+8)^2 = a^2+16a+64$ . $a^2+16a+64-144=a^2+16a-80=0$ . To apply the quadratic formula, we rewrite $a^2+16a-80$ as $a^2+16a+-80$ . Then the formula yields: $\frac{-16\pm24}{2}$ . Which is, $-8\pm12$ . This gives $-20$ and $4$ , which sums up to $\boxed{-16\text{ (A)}}$ . ~AVM2023

## Solution 2 (Slow)
We first rewrite $4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0$ as $4x^2 + (a+8)x + 9 = 0$ . Since there is only one root, the discriminant, $(a+8)^2-144$ , has to be 0. We expand $(a+8)^2$ as $a^2+16a+64$ . Applying our discriminant rule yields: $a^2+16a+64-144=a^2+16a-80=0$ . To apply the quadratic formula, we rewrite $a^2+16a-80$ as $a^2+16a+-80$ . Then the formula yields: $\frac{-16\pm24}{2}$ . Which is, $-8\pm12$ . Notice that we have to find the sum of the two values, since the average is obviously $-8$ , the sum is $2\cdot-8=\boxed{-16\text{ (A)}}$ . ~AVM2023

## Solution 3 (Quick)
We first rewrite $4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0$ as $4x^2 + (a+8)x + 9 = 0$ . Since there is only one root, the discriminant, $(a+8)^2-144$ , has to be 0. We solve the remaining as below: $(a+8)^2-144=0$ so $(a+8)^2=144$ . So $a+8$ is either $12$ or $-12$ , which make $a$ either $4$ or $-20$ , respectively. The sum of these values is $\boxed{-16\text{ (A)}}$ . ~AVM2023

We solve the remaining as below: $(a+8)^2-144=0$ so $(a+8)^2=144$ . So $a+8$ is either $12$ or $-12$ , which make $2a+16=0$ , the sum, or $2a$ , is $\boxed{-16\text{ (A)}}$ . ~AVM2023
