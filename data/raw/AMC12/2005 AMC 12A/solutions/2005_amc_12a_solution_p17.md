## Problem

A unit cube is cut twice to form three triangular prisms, two of which are congruent, as shown in Figure $1$ . The cube is then cut in the same manner along the dashed lines shown in Figure $2$ . This creates nine pieces. What is the volume of the piece that contains vertex $W$ ?

$(\mathrm {A}) \ \frac{1}{12} \qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ \frac{1}{9} \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ \frac{1}{8} \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ \frac{1}{6} \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ \frac{1}{4}$

## Solution
It is a pyramid with height $1$ and base area $\frac{1}{4}$ , so using the formula for the volume of a pyramid, $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \cdot (1) = \frac {1}{12} \Rightarrow \boxed{(\mathrm {A})}$ .
