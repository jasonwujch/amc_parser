# 2005 AMC 12A Problem 6

## Problem

Josh and Mike live $13$ miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had Mike ridden when they met?

$(\mathrm {A}) \ 4 \qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ 5 \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ 6 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ 7 \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ 8$

## Solution
Let $D_J, D_M$ be the distances traveled by Josh and Mike, respectively, and let $r,t$ be the time and rate of Mike. Using $d = rt$ , we have that $D_M = rt$ and $D_J = \left(\frac{4}{5}r\right)\left(2t\right) = \frac 85rt$ . Then $13 = D_M + D_J = rt + \frac{8}{5}rt = \frac{13}{5}rt$ $\Longrightarrow rt = D_M = 5\ \mathrm{(B)}$ .
