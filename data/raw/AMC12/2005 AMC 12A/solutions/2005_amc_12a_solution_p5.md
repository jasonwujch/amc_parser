## Problem

The average (mean) of $20$ numbers is $30$ , and the average of $30$ other numbers is $20$ . What is the average of all $50$ numbers?

$(\mathrm {A}) \ 23 \qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ 24 \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ 25 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ 10 \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ 27$

## Solution

## Solution 1
The sum of the first $20$ numbers is $20 \cdot 30$ and the sum of the other $30$ numbers is $30\cdot 20$ . Hence the overall average is $\frac{20 \cdot 30 + 30 \cdot 20}{50} = 24 \ \mathrm{(B)}$ .

## Solution 2
This is just the harmonic mean, so the answer is $\frac{2 \cdot 20 \cdot 30}{20+30}=24 \ \mathrm{(B)}$ .
