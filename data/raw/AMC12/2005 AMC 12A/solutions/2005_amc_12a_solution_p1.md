## Problem

Two is $10 \%$ of $x$ and $20 \%$ of $y$ . What is $x - y$ ?

$(\mathrm {A}) \ 1 \qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ 2 \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ 5 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ 10 \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ 20$

## Solution
$2 = \frac {1}{10}x \Longrightarrow x = 20,\quad 2 = \frac{1}{5}y \Longrightarrow y = 10,\quad x-y = 20 - 10=10 \mathrm{(D)}$ .
