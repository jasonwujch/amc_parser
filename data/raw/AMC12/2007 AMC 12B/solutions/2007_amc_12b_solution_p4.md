## Problem

At Frank's Fruit Market, $3$ bananas cost as much as $2$ apples, and $6$ apples cost as much as $4$ oranges. How many oranges cost as much as $18$ bananas?

$\textbf{(A) } 6 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 8 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 9 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 12 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 18$

## Solution
$3$ bananas cost as much as $2$ apples, so $18$ bananas cost as much as $12$ apples. Since $6$ apples cost as much as $4$ oranges, $12$ apples cost as much as $8$ oranges, giving $(B)$ .
