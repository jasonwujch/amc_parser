### Problem

How many pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$ are there such that $\text{gcd}(a,b)=1$ and $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{14b}{9a}$ is an integer?

$\mathrm {(A)}\ 4\quad\mathrm {(B)}\ 6\quad\mathrm {(C)}\ 9\quad\mathrm {(D)}\ 12\quad\mathrm {(E)}\ \text{infinitely many}$

## Solution 1
Combining the fraction, $\frac{9a^2 + 14b^2}{9ab}$ must be an integer.
Since the denominator contains a factor of $9$ , $9 | 9a^2 + 14b^2 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad 9 | b^2 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad 3 | b$
Since $b = 3n$ for some positive integer $n$ , we can rewrite the fraction(divide by $9$ on both top and bottom) as $\frac{a^2 + 14n^2}{3an}$
Since the denominator now contains a factor of $n$ , we get $n | a^2 + 14n^2 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad n | a^2$ .
But since $1=\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(a,3n)=\gcd(a,n)$ , we must have $n=1$ , and thus $b=3$ .
For $b=3$ the original fraction simplifies to $\frac{a^2 + 14}{3a}$ .
For that to be an integer, $a$ must be a factor of $14$ , and therefore we must have $a\in\{1,2,7,14\}$ . Each of these values does indeed yield an integer.
Thus there are four solutions: $(1,3)$ , $(2,3)$ , $(7,3)$ , $(14,3)$ and the answer is $\mathrm{(A)}$

## Solution 2
Let's assume that $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{14b}{9a} = m$ We get
$9a^2 - 9mab + 14b^2 = 0$
Factoring this, we get $4$ equations-
$(3a-2b)(3a-7b) = 0$
$(3a-b)(3a-14b) = 0$
$(a-2b)(9a-7b) = 0$
$(a-b)(9a-14b) = 0$
(It's all negative, because if we had positive signs, $a$ would be the opposite sign of $b$ )
Now we look at these, and see that-
$3a=2b$
$3a=b$
$3a=7b$
$3a=14b$
$a=2b$
$9a=7b$
$a=b$
$9a=14b$
This gives us $8$ solutions, but we note that the middle term needs to give you back $9m$ .
For example, in the case
$(a-2b)(9a-7b)$ , the middle term is $-25ab$ , which is not equal by $-9m$ for any integer $m$ .
Similar reason for the fourth equation. This eliminates the last four solutions out of the above eight listed, giving us 4 solutions total $\mathrm {(A)}$

## Solution 3
Let $u = \frac{a}{b}$ . Then the given equation becomes $u + \frac{14}{9u} = \frac{9u^2 + 14}{9u}$ .
Let's set this equal to some value, $k \Rightarrow \frac{9u^2 + 14}{9u} = k$ .
Clearing the denominator and simplifying, we get a quadratic in terms of $u$ :
$9u^2 - 9ku + 14 = 0 \Rightarrow u = \frac{9k \pm \sqrt{(9k)^2 - 504}}{18}$
Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $u$ is a rational number. This means that $\sqrt{(9k)^2 - 504}$ is an integer.
Let $\sqrt{(9k)^2 - 504} = x$ . Squaring and rearranging yields:
$(9k)^2 - x^2 = 504$
$(9k+x)(9k-x) = 504$ .
In order for both $x$ and $a$ to be an integer, $9k + x$ and $9k - x$ must both be odd or even. (This is easily proven using modular arithmetic.) In the case of this problem, both must be even. Let $9k + x = 2m$ and $9k - x = 2n$ .
Then:
$2m \cdot 2n = 504$
$mn = 126$ .
Factoring 126, we get $6$ pairs of numbers: $(1,126), (2,63), (3,42), (6,21), (7,18),$ and $(9,14)$ .
Looking back at our equations for $m$ and $n$ , we can solve for $k = \frac{2m + 2n}{18} = \frac{m+n}{9}$ . Since $k$ is an integer, there are only $2$ pairs of $(m,n)$ that work: $(3,42)$ and $(6,21)$ . This means that there are $2$ values of $k$ such that $u$ is an integer. But looking back at $u$ in terms of $k$ , we have $\pm$ , meaning that there are $2$ values of $u$ for every $k$ . Thus, the answer is $2 \cdot 2 = 4 \Rightarrow \mathrm{(A)}$ .

## Solution 4
Rewriting the expression over a common denominator yields $\frac{9a^2 + 14b^2}{9ab}$ . This expression must be equal to some integer $m$ .
Thus, $\frac{9a^2 + 14b^2}{9ab} = m \rightarrow 9a^2 + 14b^2 = 9abm$ . Taking this $\pmod{a}$ yields $14b^2 \equiv 0\pmod{a}$ . Since $\gcd(a,b)=1$ , $14 \equiv 0\pmod{a}$ . This implies that $a|14$ so $a = 1, 2, 7, 14$ .
We can then take $9a^2 + 14b^2 = 9abm \pmod{b}$ to get that $9 \equiv 0 \pmod{b}$ . Thus $b = 1, 3, 9$ .
However, taking $9a^2 + 14b^2 = 9abm \pmod{3}$ , $b^2 \equiv 0\pmod{3}$ so $b$ cannot equal 1.
Also, note that if $b = 9$ , $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{14b}{9a} = \frac{a}{9}+\frac{14}{a}$ . Since $a|14$ , $\frac{14}{a}$ will be an integer, but $\frac{a}{9}$ will not be an integer since none of the possible values of $a$ are multiples of 9. Thus, $b$ cannot equal 9.
Thus, the only possible values of $b$ is 3, and $a$ can be 1, 2, 7, or 14. This yields 4 possible solutions, so the answer is $\mathrm{(A)}$ .

## Solution 5 (Similar to Solution 1)
Rewriting $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{14b}{9a}$ over a common denominator gives $\frac{9a^2 + 14b^2}{9ab}.$
Thus, we have $9 \mid 9a^2 + 14b^2 \Rightarrow 3 \mid b.$
Next, we have $ab \mid 9a^2+14b^2 \Rightarrow ab \mid 14b^2 \Rightarrow a \mid 14b.$
Thus, $a \in (1,2,7,4).$
Next, we have $b \mid 9a^2 + 14b^2 \Rightarrow b \mid 9a^2 \Rightarrow b \mid 9.$
Thus, $b \in (1,3,9).$
Now, we simply do casework on $b.$
Plugging in $b = 1,3$ and $9$ gives that there are $4$ total solutions for $(a,b).$

## Solution 6 (Similar to solution 3)
Let $\frac{a}{b} = r.$ So $r + \frac{14}{9r}=I$ , where I is an integer. Algebraic manipulations yield: $r^2-Ir+\frac{14}{9}=0$ . The discriminant of this must be the square of a rational number, call this R. So $I^2-\frac{56}{9}=R^2 \longrightarrow I^2-R^2=(I-R)(I+R)=\frac{56}{9}$ . I is $\frac{1}{2}$ the sum of $I-R$ and $I+R$ . To have an integer sum, $I-R$ and $I+R$ must have the same denominator, namely 3. We proceed with casework.
Case 1. $I+R=56/3$ , $I-R=1/3$ . This yields $I=19/2$ , which is not an integer. This case produces 0 solutions.
Case 2. $I+R=28/3$ , $I-R=2/3$ . This yields $I=5$ . Substituting into our original equation yields: $r^2-5r+\frac{14}{9}=0$ . Factoring gives: $r=\frac{1}{3}$ , $r=\frac{14}{3}$ . This case produces 2 solutions, namely (1,3) and (14,3).
Case 3. $I+R=14/3$ , $I-R=4/3$ . This yields $I=3$ . Substituting into our original equation yields: $r^2-3r+\frac{14}{9}=0$ . Factoring gives: $r=\frac{2}{3}$ , $r=\frac{7}{3}$ . This case produces 2 solutions, namely (2,3) and (7,3).
Case 4. $I+R=8/3$ , $I-R=7/3$ . This yields $I=5/2$ , which is not an integer. This case produces 0 solutions.
Altogether, we have 4 solutions, so our answer is $\boxed{(A)}$ .

## Solution 7
Rewrite the equation $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{14b}{9a}=k$ in two different forms. First, multiply both sides by $b$ and subtract $a$ to obtain $\frac{14b^2}{9a}=bk-a.$ Because $a$ , $b$ , and $k$ are integers, $14b^2$ must be a multiple of $a$ , and because $a$ and $b$ have no common factors greater than 1, it follows that 14 is divisible by $a$ . Next, multiply both sides of the original equation by $9a$ and subtract $14b$ to obtain $\frac{9a^2}{b}=9ak-14b.$ This shows that $9a^2$ is a multiple of $b$ , so 9 must be divisible by $b$ . Thus if $(a,b)$ is a solution, then $b=1$ , $3$ , or $9$ , and $a=1$ , 2, 7, or 14. This gives a total of twelve possible solutions $(a,b)$ , each of which can be checked quickly. $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{14b}{9a}$ will only be an integer when $(a,b) \in \{(1,3),(2,3), (7,3), (14,3)\},$ for a total of $\boxed{4}$ pairs.
