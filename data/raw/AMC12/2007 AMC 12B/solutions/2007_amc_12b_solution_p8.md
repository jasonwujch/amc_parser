# 2007 AMC 12B Problem 8

## Problem

Tom's age is $T$ years, which is also the sum of the ages of his three children. His age $N$ years ago was twice the sum of their ages then. What is $T/N$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 2 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 3 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 5 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 6$

## Solution
Tom's age $N$ years ago was $T-N$ . The sum of the ages of his three children $N$ years ago was $T-3N,$ since there are three children. If his age $N$ years ago was twice the sum of the children's ages then, \begin{align*}T-N&=2(T-3N)\\ T-N&=2T-6N\\ T&=5N\\ T/N&=\boxed{\mathrm{(D) \ } 5}\end{align*} Note that actual values were not found.
