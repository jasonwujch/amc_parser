# 2007 AMC 12B Problem 12

## Problem

A teacher gave a test to a class in which $10\%$ of the students are juniors and $90\%$ are seniors. The average score on the test was $84.$ The juniors all received the same score, and the average score of the seniors was $83.$ What score did each of the juniors receive on the test?

$\textbf{(A) } 85 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 88 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 93 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 94 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 98$

## Solution
We can assume there are $10$ people in the class. Then there will be $1$ junior and $9$ seniors. The sum of everyone's scores is $10 \cdot 84 = 840$ . Since the average score of the seniors was $83$ , the sum of all the senior's scores is $9 \cdot 83 = 747$ . The only score that has not been added to that is the junior's score, which is $840 - 747 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 93}$

## Solution 2
Let the average score of the juniors be $j$ . The problem states the average score of the seniors is $83$ . The equation for the average score of the class (juniors and seniors combined) is $\frac{j}{10} + \frac{83 \cdot 9}{10} = 84$ . Simplifying this equation yields $j = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 93}$
