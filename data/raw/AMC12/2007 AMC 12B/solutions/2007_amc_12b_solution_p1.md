# 2007 AMC 12B Problem 1

## Problem

Isabella's house has $3$ bedrooms. Each bedroom is $12$ feet long, $10$ feet wide, and $8$ feet high. Isabella must paint the walls of all the bedrooms. Doorways and windows, which will not be painted, occupy $60$ square feet in each bedroom. How many square feet of walls must be painted?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 678 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 768 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 786 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 867 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 876$

## Solution
There are four walls in each bedroom (she can't paint floors or ceilings). Therefore, we calculate the number of square feet of walls there is in one bedroom: \[2\cdot(12\cdot8+10\cdot8)-60=2\cdot176-60=292\] We have three bedrooms, so she must paint $292\cdot3=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }876}$ square feet of walls.
