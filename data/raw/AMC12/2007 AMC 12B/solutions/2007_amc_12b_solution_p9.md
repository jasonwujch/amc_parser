# 2007 AMC 12B Problem 9

## Problem

A function $f$ has the property that $f(3x-1)=x^2+x+1$ for all real numbers $x$ . What is $f(5)$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 7 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 13 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 31 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 111 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 211$

## Solution
$3x-1 =5 \implies x= 2$
$f(3(2)-1) = 2^2+2+1=7 \implies (A)$
