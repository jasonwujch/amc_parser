# 2007 AMC 12B Problem 7

## Problem

All sides of the convex pentagon $ABCDE$ are of equal length, and $\angle A = \angle B = 90^{\circ}$ . What is the degree measure of $\angle E$ ?

$\mathrm {(A)}\ 90 \qquad \mathrm {(B)}\ 108 \qquad \mathrm {(C)}\ 120 \qquad \mathrm {(D)}\ 144 \qquad \mathrm {(E)}\ 150$

## Solution
Since $A$ and $B$ are right angles , and $AE$ equals $BC$ , and $AECB$ is a square . Since the length of $ED$ and $CD$ are also 5, triangle $CDE$ is equilateral . Angle $E$ is therefore $90+60=150 \Rightarrow \mathrm {(E)}$
