# 2007 AMC 12B Problem 3

## Problem

The point $O$ is the center of the circle circumscribed about triangle $ABC$ , with $\angle BOC = 120^{\circ}$ and $\angle AOB = 140^{\circ}$ , as shown. What is the degree measure of $\angle ABC$ ?

$\mathrm {(A)} 35 \qquad \mathrm {(B)} 40 \qquad \mathrm {(C)} 45 \qquad \mathrm {(D)} 50 \qquad \mathrm {(E)} 60$

## Solution
Since triangles $ABO$ and $BOC$ are isosceles, $\angle ABO=20^o$ and $\angle OBC=30^o$ . Therefore, $\angle ABC=50^o$ , or $\mathrm{(D)}$ .

## Alternative Solution
$\angle AOC = 100^{\circ} \implies \angle ABC =\frac{\angle AOC}{2} =50^{ \circ},$ or $\mathrm{(D)}.$
