## Problem

A triangle with side lengths in the ratio $3 : 4 : 5$ is inscribed in a circle with radius 3. What is the area of the triangle?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 8.64\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 12\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 5\pi\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 17.28\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 18$

## Solution
Since 3-4-5 is a Pythagorean triple , the triangle is a right triangle . Since the hypotenuse is a diameter of the circumcircle , the hypotenuse is $2r = 6$ . Then the other legs are $\frac{24}5=4.8$ and $\frac{18}5=3.6$ . The area is $\frac{4.8 \cdot 3.6}2 = 8.64\ \mathrm{(A)}$

## Solution 2
The hypotenuse of the triangle is a diameter of the circumcircle, so it has length $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ . The triangle is similar to a 3-4-5 triangle with the ratio of their side lengths equal to $\frac{6}{5}$ . The area of a 3-4-5 triangle is $\frac{3\cdot 4}{2} = 6$ . The square of the ratio of their side lengths is equal to the ratio of their areas. Call the area of the triangle $A$ . Therefore, $\left(\frac{6}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{A}{6} \Longrightarrow \frac{36}{25} = \frac{A}{6} \Longrightarrow A = \frac{36\cdot6}{25} = 8.64\ \mathrm{(A)}$

## Solution 3 (dimensional analysis)
Using the theorem that the hypotenuse of a right triangle inscribed in a circle is the diameter, one can determine that the diameter of the triangle is 6. As a result the ratio between the triangular ratios and their real values is (6/5). Using dimensional analysis, one can see that because the ratio between lengths is (6/5), the ratio between areas is (6/5)^2. This gives ((3 * 4)(6/5)^2)/2 as the area of the triangle or answer choice (A).

## Solution 4
Let the sides of the triangle be $3x, 4x, 5x$ for some $x$ . Now use the fact that the area of a triangle is equal to $\frac{abc}{4R}$ , where $a, b, c$ are side lengths and $R$ is the circumradius. Also note that due to the 3, 4, 5 triple, the triangle is right. Thus we get $\frac{12x^2}{2} = \frac{60x^3}{4\cdot 3}\Rightarrow x = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2$ . Then the area is $12(1.2)^2/2 = \boxed{8.64 \text{ (A)}}$ .
