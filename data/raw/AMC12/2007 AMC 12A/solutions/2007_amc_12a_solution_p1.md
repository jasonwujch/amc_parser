## Problem

One ticket to a show costs $\$ $20$ at full price. Susan buys 4 tickets using a coupon that gives her a 25% discount. Pam buys 5 tickets using a coupon that gives her a 30% discount. How many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 2\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 5\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 10\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 15\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 20$

## Official Solution
$\textbf{Answer: (C)}$ Susan pays $(4)(0.75)(20) = 60$ dollars. Pam pays $(5)(0.70)(20) = 70$ dollars, so she pays $70-60=10$ more dollars than Susan.
