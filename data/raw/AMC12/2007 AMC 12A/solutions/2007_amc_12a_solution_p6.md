# 2007 AMC 12A Problem 6

## Problem

Triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are isosceles with $AB=BC$ and $AD=DC$ . Point $D$ is inside triangle $ABC$ , angle $ABC$ measures $40$ degrees, and angle $ADC$ measures $140$ degrees. What is the degree measure of angle $BAD$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 20\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 30\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 40\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 50\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 60$

## Solution 1
We angle chase and find out that:
- $\angle DAC=\frac{180-140}{2} = 20$
- $\angle BAC=\frac{180-40}{2} = 70$
- $\angle BAD=\angle BAC- \angle DAC=50\ \mathrm{(D)}$

## Solution 2
Since triangle $ABC$ is isosceles we know that angle $\angle BAC = \angle BCA$ .
Also since triangle $ADC$ is isosceles we know that $\angle DAC = \angle DCA$ .
This implies that $\angle BAD = \angle BCD$ .
Then the sum of the interior angles of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $40 + 220 + 2\angle BAD = 360$ .
Solving the equation, we get $\angle BAD = 50$ .
Therefore the answer is $\mathrm{(D)}$ .

## Solution 3
Using the previous drawing we know that ACD and DAC are both equal to 20 (40/2 or (180-40)/2). We also know that BAC and BCA are both 70 or (180-40)/2. Thus BDA is 70-20 which is equal to 50.
