# 2007 AMC 12A Problem 15

## Problem

The set $\{3,6,9,10\}$ is augmented by a fifth element $n$ , not equal to any of the other four. The median of the resulting set is equal to its mean . What is the sum of all possible values of $n$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 7\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 9\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 19\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 24\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 26$

## Solution
The median must either be $6, 9,$ or $n$ . Casework :
- Median is $6$ : Then $n \le 6$ and $\frac{3+6+9+10+n}{5} = 6 \Longrightarrow n = 2$ .
- Median is $9$ : Then $n \ge 9$ and $\frac{3+6+9+10+n}{5} = 9 \Longrightarrow n = 17$ .
- Median is $n$ : Then $6 < n < 9$ and $\frac{3+6+9+10+n}{5} = n \Longrightarrow n = 7$ .
All three cases are valid, so our solution is $2 + 7 + 17 = 26 \Longrightarrow \mathrm{(E)}$ .
