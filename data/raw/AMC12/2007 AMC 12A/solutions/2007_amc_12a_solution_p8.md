# 2007 AMC 12A Problem 8

## Problem

A star- polygon is drawn on a clock face by drawing a chord from each number to the fifth number counted clockwise from that number. That is, chords are drawn from 12 to 5, from 5 to 10, from 10 to 3, and so on, ending back at 12. What is the degree measure of the angle at each vertex in the star polygon?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 20\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 24\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 30\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 36\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 60$

## Solution
We look at the angle between 12, 5, and 10. It subtends $\frac 16$ of the circle, or $60$ degrees (or you can see that the arc is $\frac 23$ of the right angle ). Thus, the angle at each vertex is an inscribed angle subtending $60$ degrees, making the answer $\frac 1260 = 30^{\circ} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{(C)}$
