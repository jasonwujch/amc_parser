# 2011 AMC 12A Problem 4

## Problem

At an elementary school, the students in third grade, fourth grade, and fifth grade run an average of $12$ , $15$ , and $10$ minutes per day, respectively. There are twice as many third graders as fourth graders, and twice as many fourth graders as fifth graders. What is the average number of minutes run per day by these students?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 12 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{37}{3} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{88}{7} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 13 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 14$

## Solution
Let us say that there are $f$ fifth graders. According to the given information, there must be $2f$ fourth graders and $4f$ third graders. The average time run by each student is equal to the total amount of time run divided by the number of students. This gives us $\frac{12\cdot 4f + 15\cdot 2f + 10\cdot f}{4f + 2f + f} = \frac{88f}{7f} = \frac{88}{7} \Rightarrow \boxed{C}$
If you want to simplify the problem even more, just imagine/assume that only $1$ fifth grader existed. Then you can simply get rid of the variables.
