## Problem

A small bottle of shampoo can hold $35$ milliliters of shampoo, whereas a large bottle can hold $500$ milliliters of shampoo. Jasmine wants to buy the minimum number of small bottles necessary to completely fill a large bottle. How many bottles must she buy?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 11 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 12 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 13 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 14 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution 1
To find how many small bottles we need, we can simply divide $500$ by $35$ . This simplifies to $\frac{100}{7}=14 \frac{2}{7}.$ Since the answer must be an integer greater than $14$ , we have to round up to $15$ bottles, or $\boxed{\textbf{E}}$

## Solution 2
We double $35$ to get $70.$ We see that $70\cdot7=490,$ which is very close to $500.$ Thus, $2\cdot7+1=\boxed{\text{(E)} 15}$ bottles are enough. ~Technodoggo
