## Problem

Last summer $30\%$ of the birds living on Town Lake were geese, $25\%$ were swans, $10\%$ were herons, and $35\%$ were ducks. What percent of the birds that were not swans were geese?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 20 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 30 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 40 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 50 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 60$

## Solution
To simplify the problem, WLOG, let us say that there were a total of $100$ birds. The number of birds that are not swans is $75$ . The number of geese is $30$ . Therefore the percentage is just $\frac{30}{75} \times 100 = 40 \Rightarrow \boxed{C}$
