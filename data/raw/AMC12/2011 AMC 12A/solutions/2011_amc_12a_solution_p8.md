## Problem

In the eight term sequence $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ , $E$ , $F$ , $G$ , $H$ , the value of $C$ is $5$ and the sum of any three consecutive terms is $30$ . What is $A+H$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 17 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 18 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 25 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 26 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 43$

## Solution 1
Let $A=x$ . Then from $A+B+C=30$ , we find that $B=25-x$ . From $B+C+D=30$ , we then get that $D=x$ . Continuing this pattern, we find $E=25-x$ , $F=5$ , $G=x$ , and finally $H=25-x$ . So $A+H=x+25-x=25 \rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{C}}$

## Solution 2
Given that the sum of 3 consecutive terms is 30, we have $(A+B+C)+(C+D+E)+(F+G+H)=90$ and $(B+C+D)+(E+F+G)=60$
It follows that $A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H=85$ because $C=5$ .
Subtracting, we have that $A+H=25\rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{C}}$ .

## Solution 3 (the tedious one)
From the given information, we can deduce the following equations:
$A+B=25, B+D=25, D+E=25, D+E+F=30, E+F+G =30$ , and $F+G+H=30$ .
We can then cleverly manipulate the equations above by adding and subtracting them to be left with the answer.
$(A+B)-(B+D)=25-25 \implies (A-D)=0$
$(A-D)+(D+E)=0+25 \implies (A+E)=25$
$(A+E)-(E+F+G)=25-30 \implies (A-F-G)=-5$ (Notice how we don't use $D+E+F=30$ )
$(A-F-G)+(F+G+H)=-5+30 \implies (A+H)=25$
Therefore, we have $A+H=25 \rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{C}}$

## Solution 4 (the cheap one)
Since all of the answer choices are constants, it shouldn't matter what we pick $A$ and $B$ to be, so let $A = 20$ and $B = 5$ . Then $D = 30 - B -C = 20$ , $E = 30 - D - C = 5$ , $F = 30 - D - E =5$ , and so on until we get $H = 5$ . Thus $A + H = \boxed{\mathbf{(C)}25}$

## Solution 5
Notice that the period of the sequence is $3$ as given. (If this isn't clear we can show an example: $A+B+C=B+C=D$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $A=D$ ). Then $A=D$ and $H=B$ , so $A+H=D+B=D+B+C-C=30-5=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\;25}$ .

## Solution 6
Since the period of the sequence is $3$ \[A=D=G, B=E=H, C=F\] $A+B+C=30$ because any three consecutive terms sum to $30$ . Since $C=5$ \[A+B=25\] Since $B=H$ \[A+B=A+H=\fbox{(C) 25}\]

### Note
Something useful to shorten a lot of the solutions above is to notice \[5 + D + E = D + E + F\] so F = 5
