## Problem

A function $f$ is defined by $f(z) = (4 + i) z^2 + \alpha z + \gamma$ for all complex numbers $z$ , where $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are complex numbers and $i^2 = - 1$ . Suppose that $f(1)$ and $f(i)$ are both real. What is the smallest possible value of $| \alpha | + |\gamma |$ ?

$\textbf{(A)} \; 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)} \; \sqrt {2} \qquad \textbf{(C)} \; 2 \qquad \textbf{(D)} \; 2 \sqrt {2} \qquad \textbf{(E)} \; 4 \qquad$

## Solution 1:
We need only concern ourselves with the imaginary portions of $f(1)$ and $f(i)$ (both of which must be 0). These are:
\begin{align*} \text{Im}(f(1)) & = i+i\text{Im}(\alpha)+i\text{Im}(\gamma) \\ \text{Im}(f(i)) & = -i+i\text{Re}(\alpha)+i\text{Im}(\gamma) \end{align*}
Let $p=\text{Im}(\gamma)$ and $q=\text{Re}{(\gamma)},$ then we know $\text{Im}(\alpha)=-p-1$ and $\text{Re}(\alpha)=1-p.$ Therefore \[|\alpha|+|\gamma|=\sqrt{(1-p)^2+(-1-p)^2}+\sqrt{q^2+p^2}=\sqrt{2p^2+2}+\sqrt{p^2+q^2},\] which reaches its minimum $\sqrt 2$ when $p=q=0$ by the Trivial Inequality. Thus, the answer is $\boxed B.$

## Solution 2:
$f(1)=4+i+\alpha+\gamma$
$f(i)=-4-i+\alpha \cdot i +\gamma$
Since $f(1)$ and $f(i)$ are both real we get, \[\alpha+\gamma=-i\] \[\alpha \cdot i+\gamma=i\]
Solving, we get $\alpha=1-i$ , $\gamma$ can be anything, to minimize the value we set $\gamma=0$ , so then the answer is $\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}$ . Thus, the answer is $\boxed{B}$
