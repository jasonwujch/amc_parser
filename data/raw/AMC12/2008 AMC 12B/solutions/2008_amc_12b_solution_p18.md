## Problem

A pyramid has a square base $ABCD$ and vertex $E$ . The area of square $ABCD$ is $196$ , and the areas of $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CDE$ are $105$ and $91$ , respectively. What is the volume of the pyramid?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 392 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 196\sqrt {6} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 392\sqrt {2} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 392\sqrt {3} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 784$

## Solution
Let $h$ be the height of the pyramid and $a$ be the distance from $h$ to $CD$ . The side length of the base is $14$ . The heights of $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CDE$ are $2\cdot105\div14=15$ and $2\cdot91\div14=13$ , respectively. Consider a side view of the pyramid from $\triangle BCE$ . We have a systems of equations through the Pythagorean Theorem:
$13^2-(14-a)^2=h^2 \\ 15^2-a^2=h^2$
Setting them equal to each other and simplifying gives $-27+28a=225 \implies a=9$ .
Therefore, $h=\sqrt{15^2-9^2}=12$ , and the volume of the pyramid is $\frac{bh}{3}=\frac{12\cdot 196}{3}=\boxed{784 \Rightarrow E}$ .
