# 2008 AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

A class collects $50$ dollars to buy flowers for a classmate who is in the hospital. Roses cost $3$ dollars each, and carnations cost $2$ dollars each. No other flowers are to be used. How many different bouquets could be purchased for exactly $50$ dollars?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 7 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 9 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 16 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 17$

## Solution
The class could send $25$ carnations and no roses, $22$ carnations and $2$ roses, $19$ carnations and $4$ roses, and so on, down to $1$ carnation and $16$ roses. There are 9 total possibilities (from 0 to 16 roses, incrementing by 2 at each step), $\Rightarrow \boxed{C}$
