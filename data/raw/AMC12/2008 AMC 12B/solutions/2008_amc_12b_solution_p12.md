## Problem

For each positive integer $n$ , the mean of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is $n$ . What is the $2008$ th term of the sequence?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2008 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 4015 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 4016 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 4030056 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 4032064$

## Solution 1
Letting $S_n$ be the nth partial sum of the sequence:
$\frac{S_n}{n} = n$
$S_n = n^2$
The only possible sequence with this result is the sequence of odd integers.
$a_n = 2n - 1$
$a_{2008} = 2(2008) - 1 = 4015 \Rightarrow \textbf{(B)}$

## Solution 2
Letting the sum of the sequence equal $a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$ yields the following two equations:
$\frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_{2008}}{2008}=2008$ and
$\frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_{2007}}{2007}=2007$ .
Therefore:
$a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_{2008}=2008^2$ and $a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_{2007}=2007^2$
Hence, by substitution, $a_{2008}=2008^2-2007^2=(2008+2007)(2008-2007)=4015(1)=4015\implies\boxed{\textbf{B}}$

## Solution 3
Since the mean will be the sum of the first $n$ terms divided by $n$ , and said mean also equals $n$ , we know that the sum must be $n^2$ . This means the sequence must compute squares, and this is done by the odd integer sequence $1+3+5+7+\ldots$ . Therefore, we must find the 2008th odd number, which is found by $2n-1 \implies 2(2008)-1 = 4015$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{B}}$ ~stress-couture
