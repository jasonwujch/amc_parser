## Problem

Four coins are picked out of a piggy bank that contains a collection of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. Which of the following could not be the total value of the four coins, in cents?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 25 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 35 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 45 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 55$

## Solution 1
Pre-Note: This solution is kinda just guessing, idk you decide.
We can solve this problem by trying out numbers to get the answer choices and use the process of elimination to get the answer. Thinking for a few seconds, you can see that for 15 cents there are no possible ways to get it. Now you may be inclined to chose $\textbf{A}$ , but we may have missed some way to get 15 cents, so we try the other answer choices. 25 cents can be made with 3 nickels and 1 dimes, 35 cents can be made with 3 dimes and 1 nickel, 45 cents can be made with 1 quarter, 1 dime, and 2 nickels, and finally, 55 cents can be made with 1 quarter and 3 dimes. Therefore the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{A}}$
