# 2009 AMC 12A Problem 23

## Problem

Functions $f$ and $g$ are quadratic , $g(x) = - f(100 - x)$ , and the graph of $g$ contains the vertex of the graph of $f$ . The four $x$ -intercepts on the two graphs have $x$ -coordinates $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ , and $x_4$ , in increasing order, and $x_3 - x_2 = 150$ . Then $x_4 - x_1 = m + n\sqrt p$ , where $m$ , $n$ , and $p$ are positive integers, and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is $m + n + p$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 602\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 652\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 702\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 752 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 802$

## Solution (Alcumus)
The two quadratics are $180^{\circ}$ rotations of each other about $(50,0)$ . Since we are only dealing with differences of roots, we can translate them to be symmetric about $(0,0)$ . Now $x_3 = - x_2 = 75$ and $x_4 = - x_1$ . Say our translated versions of $f$ and $g$ are $p$ and $q$ , respectively, so that $p(x) = - q( - x)$ . Let $x_3 = 75$ be a root of $p$ and $x_2 = - 75$ a root of $q$ by symmetry. Note that since they each contain each other's vertex, $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ , and $x_4$ must be roots of alternating polynomials, so $x_1$ is a root of $p$ and $x_4$ a root of $q$
The vertex of $p(x)$ is half the sum of its roots, or $\frac {75 + x_1}{2}$ . We are told that the vertex of one quadratic lies on the other, so
Let $x_1 = 75u$ and divide through by $75^2$ , since it will drastically simplify computations. We know $u < - 1$ and that $(u - 1)^2 = (3u + 1)(u + 3)$ , or
So $u = \frac { - 6\pm\sqrt {32}}{2} = - 3\pm2\sqrt2$ . Since $u < - 1$ , $u = - 3 - 2\sqrt2$ .
The answer is $x_4 - x_1 = (-x_1) - x_1 = - 150u = 450 + 300\sqrt {2}$ , and $450 + 300 + 2 = 752\ \mathbf{(D)}$ .
### Note
Actually it is not necessary to solve any quadratic equations, if one utilizes the two facts about the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$ ( $a>0$ ) that (i) the difference of the two quadratic roots equals to $\sqrt{\Delta}/a$ , and (ii) that the minimum value of a quadratic equals to $-\Delta/4a$ , where $\Delta=b^2-4ac$ . Here is a possible adjustment to the solution:
Without loss of generality we may "shift" $f$ , $g$ , $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ $50$ units to the left, then the differences of $x_i$ remain the same, $x_3$ and $x_2$ are symmetrical about $0$ , so $x_2=-75$ , $x_3=75$ . The relationship of $f$ , $g$ becomes $g(x)=-f(-x)$ . So we may write:
\[f(x)=a(x-b)^2 + m\] \[g(x)=-a(x+b)^2 - m\]
Again without loss of generality, we can assume $a>0$ and $b>0$ (Short argument is needed here instead of the lazy "wlog"). Also, the vertex of $f$ is $(b,m)$ , so $m=g(b)=-4ab^2-m$ , or $m=-2ab^2 <0$ .
Since $x_2,x_4$ are roots of $f$ , we have the following relationship of the roots: \[x_2 + x_4 = 2b\] \[x_4 - x_2 = \sqrt{\Delta}/a = \sqrt{-4am}/a = 2\sqrt{-m/a} = 2\sqrt{2b^2} = 2\sqrt{2}b = \sqrt{2} (x_2+x_4)\]
So $(\sqrt{2}-1)x_4 = 75(1+\sqrt{2})$ , or $x_4 = 75(1+\sqrt{2})^2 = 75(3+2\sqrt{2})$ .
Therefore $x_4-x_1=2x_4=450+300\sqrt{2}$ .

## Solution 2
$g(x) = g(50-(50-x), f(x) = f(50+(50-x))$
$=>$ the two functions are symmetric over $x=50$
$x_3-x_2 = 150 => x_2 = -25, x_3 = 125$
$g(x) = a(x-x_1)(x-x_3) = a[2(150+m)+m]m$
$f(x) = -a(x-x_2)(x_x-x_4)$
$\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $=-a(150+m)(-(150+m))$
$\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $\space$ $=a(150+m)^2$
$m^2+2m(150+m) = (150+m)^2$
$3m^2+300m = m^2+300m+150^2$
$m = 75\sqrt{2}$
Therefore $x_4-x_1 = 3(150+m) + m = 450+300\sqrt{2}$ $\space$ $450+300+2 = \boxed{752}$
