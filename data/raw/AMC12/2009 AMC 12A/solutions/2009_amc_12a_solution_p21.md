# 2009 AMC 12A Problem 21

## Problem

Let $p(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ , where $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are complex numbers. Suppose that

What is the number of nonreal zeros of $x^{12} + ax^8 + bx^4 + c$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 6\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 8\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 10\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 12$

## Solution
From the three zeroes, we have $p(x) = (x - (2009 + 9002\pi i))(x - 2009)(x - 9002)$ .
Then $p(x^4) = (x^4 - (2009 + 9002\pi i))(x^4 - 2009)(x^4 - 9002)=x^{12}+ax^8+bx^4+c$ .
Let's do each factor case by case:
- $x^4 - (2009 + 9002\pi i) = 0$ : Clearly, all the fourth roots are going to be complex.
- $x^4 - 2009 = 0$ : The real roots are $\pm \sqrt [4]{2009}$ , and there are two complex roots.
- $x^4 - 9002 = 0$ : The real roots are $\pm \sqrt [4]{9002}$ , and there are two complex roots.
So the answer is $4 + 2 + 2 = 8\ \mathbf{(C)}$ .
### Alternative Thinking
Consider the graph of $x^4$ . It is similar to a parabola, but with a wider "base". First examine $x^4-2009$ and $x^4-9002$ . Clearly they are just being translated down some large amount. This will result in the $x$ -axis being crossed twice, indicating $2$ real zeroes. From the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra we know that a polynomial must have exactly as many roots as its highest degree, so we are left with $4-2$ or $2$ nonreal roots for each of the graphs. For the graph of $x^4-(2009+9002\pi i)$ , it's not even possible to graph it on the Cartesian plane, so all $4$ roots will be nonreal. This is $2+2+4 = 8$ total nonreal roots $\Rightarrow \boxed{\text{C}}$ .
