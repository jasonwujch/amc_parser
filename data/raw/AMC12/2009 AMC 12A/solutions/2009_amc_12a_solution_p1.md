# 2009 AMC 12A Problem 1

## Problem

Kim's flight took off from Newark at 10:34 AM and landed in Miami at 1:18 PM. Both cities are in the same time zone. If her flight took $h$ hours and $m$ minutes, with $0 < m < 60$ , what is $h + m$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 46 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 47 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 50 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 53 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 54$

## Solution
There is $1$ hour and $60-34 = 26$ minutes between 10:34 AM and noon; and there is $1$ hour and $18$ minutes between noon and 1:18 PM. Hence the flight took $2$ hours and $26 + 18 = 44$ minutes,and 2+44=46s0 $h+m= 46\ \textbf{(A)}$ .
