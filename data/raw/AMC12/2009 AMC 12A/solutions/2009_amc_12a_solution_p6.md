## Problem

Suppose that $P = 2^m$ and $Q = 3^n$ . Which of the following is equal to $12^{mn}$ for every pair of integers $(m,n)$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ P^2Q \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ P^nQ^m \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ P^nQ^{2m} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ P^{2m}Q^n \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ P^{2n}Q^m$

## Solution
We have $12^{mn} = (2\cdot 2\cdot 3)^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} = (2^m)^{2n} \cdot (3^n)^m = \boxed{\bold{E)} P^{2n} Q^m}$ .
