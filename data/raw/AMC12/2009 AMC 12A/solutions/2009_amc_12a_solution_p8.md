## Problem

Four congruent rectangles are placed as shown. The area of the outer square is $4$ times that of the inner square. What is the ratio of the length of the longer side of each rectangle to the length of its shorter side?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \sqrt {10} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 2 + \sqrt2 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 2\sqrt3 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 4$

## Solution 1
The area of the outer square is $4$ times that of the inner square. Therefore the side of the outer square is $\sqrt 4 = 2$ times that of the inner square.
Then the shorter side of the rectangle is $1/4$ of the side of the outer square, and the longer side of the rectangle is $3/4$ of the side of the outer square, hence their ratio is $\boxed{3}$ .

## Solution 2
Let the side length of the smaller square be $1$ , and let the smaller side of the rectangles be $y$ . Since the larger square's area is four times larger than the smaller square's, the larger square's side length is $2$ . $2$ is equivalent to $2y+1$ , giving $y=1/2$ . Then, the longer side of the rectangles is $3/2$ . $\frac{\frac{3}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}}=\boxed{3}$ .

## Solution 3
Let the longer side length be $x$ , and the shorter side be $a$ .
We have that $(x+a)^2=4(x-a)^2\implies x+a=2(x-a)\implies x+a=2x-2a\implies x=3a \implies \frac{x}{a}=3$
Hence, the answer is $\boxed{A}\implies 3$

## Solution 4
WLOG, let the shorter side of the rectangle be $1$ , and the longer side be $x$ . Thus, the area of the larger square is $(1+x)^2$ . The area of the smaller square is $(x-1)^2$ . Thus, we have the equation $(1+x)^2 = 4 (x-2)^2$ . Solving for $x$ , we get $x$ = $3$ .
