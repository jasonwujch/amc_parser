# 2009 AMC 12A Problem 7

## Problem

The first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are $2x - 3$ , $5x - 11$ , and $3x + 1$ respectively. The $n$ th term of the sequence is $2009$ . What is $n$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 255 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 502 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 1004 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 1506 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 8037$

## Solution
As this is an arithmetic sequence, the difference must be constant: $(5x-11) - (2x-3) = (3x+1) - (5x-11)$ . This solves to $x=4$ . The first three terms then are $5$ , $9$ , and $13$ . In general, the $n$ th term is $1+4n$ . Solving $1+4n=2009$ , we get $n=\boxed{502}$ .
