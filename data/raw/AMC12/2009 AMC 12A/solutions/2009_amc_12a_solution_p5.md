# 2009 AMC 12A Problem 5

## Problem

One dimension of a cube is increased by $1$ , another is decreased by $1$ , and the third is left unchanged. The volume of the new rectangular solid is $5$ less than that of the cube. What was the volume of the cube?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 27 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 64 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 125 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 216$

## Solution
Let the original cube have edge length $a$ . Then its volume is $a^3$ . The new box has dimensions $a-1$ , $a$ , and $a+1$ , hence its volume is $(a-1)a(a+1) = a^3-a$ . The difference between the two volumes is $a$ . As we are given that the difference is $5$ , we have $a=5$ , and the volume of the original cube was $5^3 = 125\Rightarrow\boxed{\text{(D)}}$ .
