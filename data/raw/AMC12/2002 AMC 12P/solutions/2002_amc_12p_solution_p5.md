# 2002 AMC 12P Problem 5

## Problem

For how many positive integers $m$ is

\[\frac{2002}{m^2 -2}\]

a positive integer?

$\text{(A) one} \qquad \text{(B) two} \qquad \text{(C) three} \qquad \text{(D) four} \qquad \text{(E) more than four}$

## Solution
For $\frac{2002}{m^2 -2}$ to be an integer, $2002$ must be divisible by $m^2-2.$ Again, memorizing the prime factorization of $2002$ is helpful. $2002 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ , so its factors are $1, 2, 7, 11, 13, 14, 22, 26, 77, 91, 143, 154, 182, 286, 1001$ , and $2002$ .
Since $m^2-2$ equals all of these, adding $2$ to our list and checking if they are perfect squares will suffice. $4, 9,$ and $16$ end up being our perfect squares, giving us an answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \text{three}}.$
