# 2002 AMC 12P Problem 3

## Problem

The dimensions of a rectangular box in inches are all positive integers and the volume of the box is $2002$ in $^3$ . Find the minimum possible sum of the three dimensions.

$\text{(A) }36 \qquad \text{(B) }38 \qquad \text{(C) }42 \qquad \text{(D) }44 \qquad \text{(E) }92$

## Solution 1
Given an arbitrary product and an arbitrary amount of positive integers to multiply to get that product, make the terms as close to each other as possible to minimize the sum. (This is a corollary that follows from the $AM-GM$ proof.)
A good rule of thumb is to memorize the prime factorization of the AMC year that you are doing, which is $2002= 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ . The three terms that are closest to each other that multiply to $2002$ are $11, 13,$ and $14$ , so our answer is $11+13+14=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 38}$ .
