# 2002 AMC 12P Problem 23

## Problem

The equation $z(z+i)(z+3i)=2002i$ has a zero of the form $a+bi$ , where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers. Find $a.$

$\text{(A) }\sqrt{118} \qquad \text{(B) }\sqrt{210} \qquad \text{(C) }2 \sqrt{210} \qquad \text{(D) }\sqrt{2002} \qquad \text{(E) }100 \sqrt{2}$

## Solution
Note that $2002 = 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 14$ . With this observation, it becomes easy to note that $z = -14i$ is a root of the given equation. However, it is not of the desired form in the problem, so we must factor the given expression to obtain the other 2 roots. From this point onwards, we assume that $z \neq -14i$ .
Expanding $z(z+i)(z+3i)=2002i$ , we have $z^3 + 4iz^2 - 3z - 2002i = 0$ . We may factor it as $(z + 14i)(z^2 - 10iz - 143) = 0$ . Since $z + 14i \neq 0$ , we must have $z^2 - 10iz - 143 = 0$ . Therefore, $z = \frac {10i \pm \sqrt{-100 + 4(143)}}{2} = 5i \pm \sqrt {118}$ .
Since $a > 0$ , we ignore the negative root. Therefore, $a = \boxed {\text{(A) } \sqrt {118}}$ .
