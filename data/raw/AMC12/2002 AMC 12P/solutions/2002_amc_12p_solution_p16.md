## Problem

The altitudes of a triangle are $12, 15,$ and $20.$ The largest angle in this triangle is

$\text{(A) }72^\circ \qquad \text{(B) }75^\circ \qquad \text{(C) }90^\circ \qquad \text{(D) }108^\circ \qquad \text{(E) }120^\circ$

## Solution
Let $a, b,$ and $c$ denote the bases of altitudes $12, 15,$ and $20,$ respectively. Since they are all altitudes and bases of the same triangle, they have the same area, so $\frac{12a}{2}=\frac{15b}{2}=\frac{20c}{2}.$ Multiplying by $2$ , we get $12a=15b=20c.$ Notice that a simple solution to the equation is if all of them equal $12 \cdot 15 \cdot 20.$ That means $a=15 \cdot 20, b=12 \cdot 20,$ and $c=12 \cdot 15.$ Simplifying our solution to check for Pythagorean triples we see that this is just a Pythagorean triple, namely a $3-4-5$ triangle. Since the other two angles of a right triangle must be acute, the right angle must be the greatest angle. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }90^\circ}.$
