## Problem

In quadrilateral $ABCD$ , $m\angle B = m \angle C = 120^{\circ}, AB=3, BC=4,$ and $CD=5.$ Find the area of $ABCD.$

$\text{(A) }15 \qquad \text{(B) }9 \sqrt{3} \qquad \text{(C) }\frac{45 \sqrt{3}}{4} \qquad \text{(D) }\frac{47 \sqrt{3}}{4} \qquad \text{(E) }15 \sqrt{3}$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Draw $AE$ parallel to $BC$ and draw $BF$ and $CG \perp AE$ , where $F$ and $G$ are on $AE$ .
It is clear that triangles $AFB$ and $EGC$ are congruent $30-60-90$ triangles. Therefore, $AF = EG = \frac{3}{2}$ and $BF = CG = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$ .
Therefore, $AE = AF + FG + GC = 4 + (2)(\frac{3}{2}) = 7$ and the area of trapezoid $ABCE$ is $(\frac{1}{2})(4+7)(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{33\sqrt{3}}{4}$ .
It remains to find the area of triangle $AED$ , which is $(\frac{1}{2})(AE)(ED)(\sin 120^{\circ}) = (\frac{1}{2})(7)(2)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2}$ .
Therefore, the total area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $\frac{33\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{47\sqrt{3}}{4}}$ .

## Solution 2
Extend $AB$ and $CD$ to meet at $E$ . Then triangle $BEC$ is equilateral, as $\angle EBC = \angle ECB = 60^{\circ}$ . Thus, $BC = CE = EB = 4$ .
Note $AE = AB + BE = 7$ and $DE = DC + CE = 9$ Then, the area of triangle $ADE$ is $\frac {1} {2} \cdot AE \cdot DE \cdot \sin{60^{\circ}} = \frac {63\sqrt{3}} {4}$ . As triangle $BEC$ is equilateral, its area is $\frac {\sqrt{3}} {4} \cdot 4^2 = \frac {16\sqrt{3}} {4}$ .
The area of $ABCD$ is the area of triangle $ADE$ minus the area of triangle $BEC$ , or $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{47\sqrt{3}}{4}}$ .
