## Problem

If $a,b,c$ are real numbers such that $a^2 + 2b =7$ , $b^2 + 4c= -7,$ and $c^2 + 6a= -14$ , find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2.$

$\text{(A) }14 \qquad \text{(B) }21 \qquad \text{(C) }28 \qquad \text{(D) }35 \qquad \text{(E) }49$

## Solution 1
Adding all of the equations gives $a^2 + b^2 +c^2 + 6a + 2b + 4c=-14.$ Adding 14 on both sides gives $a^2 + b^2 +c^2 + 6a + 2b + 4c+14=0.$ Notice that 14 can split into $9, 1,$ and $4,$ which coincidentally makes $a^2 +6a, b^2+2b,$ and $c^2+4c$ into perfect squares. Therefore, $(a+3)^2 + (b+1)^2 + (c+2) ^2 =0.$ An easy solution to this equation is $a=-3, b=-1,$ and $c=-2.$ Plugging in that solution, we get $a^2+b^2+c^2=(-3)^2+(-1)^2+(-2)^2=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 14}.$
