# 2002 AMC 12P Problem 9

## Problem

Two walls and the ceiling of a room meet at right angles at point $P.$ A fly is in the air one meter from one wall, eight meters from the other wall, and nine meters from point $P$ . How many meters is the fly from the ceiling?

$\text{(A) }\sqrt{13} \qquad \text{(B) }\sqrt{14} \qquad \text{(C) }\sqrt{15} \qquad \text{(D) }4 \qquad \text{(E) }\sqrt{17}$

## Solution
We can use the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular prism, or $d=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$ The problem gives us $a=1, b=8,$ and $d=9.$ Solving gives us $9=\sqrt{1^2 + 8^2 + c^2} \implies c^2=9^2-8^2-1^2 \implies c^2=16 \implies c=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 4}.$
