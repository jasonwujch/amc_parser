# 2002 AMC 12P Problem 21

## Problem

Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers greater than $1$ for which there exists a positive real number $c,$ different from $1$ , such that

\[2(\log_a{c} + \log_b{c}) = 9\log_{ab}{c}.\]

Find the largest possible value of $\log_a b.$

$\text{(A) }\sqrt{2} \qquad \text{(B) }\sqrt{3} \qquad \text{(C) }2 \qquad \text{(D) }\sqrt{6} \qquad \text{(E) }3$

## Solution
We may rewrite the given equation as \[2 \left(\frac {\log c}{\log a} + \frac {\log c}{\log b} \right) = \frac {9\log c}{\log a + \log b}\] Since $c \neq 1$ , we have $\log c \neq 0$ , so we may divide by $\log c$ on both sides. After making the substitutions $x = \log a$ and $y = \log b$ , our equation becomes \[\frac {2}{x} + \frac {2}{y} = \frac {9}{x+y}\]
Rewriting the left-hand side gives \[\frac {2(x+y)}{xy} = \frac {9}{x+y}\]
Cross-multiplying gives $2(x+y)^2 = 9xy$ or \[2x^2 - 5xy + 2y^2 = 0\]
Factoring gives $(2x-y)(x-2y) = 0$ or $\frac {x}{y} = 2, \frac {1}{2}$ .
Recall that $\frac {x}{y} = \frac {\log a}{\log b} = \log_{a} b$ . Therefore, the maximum value of $\log_{a} b$ is $\boxed {\text{(C) }2}$ .
