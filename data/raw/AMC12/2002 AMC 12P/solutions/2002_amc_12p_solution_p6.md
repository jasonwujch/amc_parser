## Problem

Participation in the local soccer league this year is $10\%$ higher than last year. The number of males increased by $5\%$ and the number of females increased by $20\%$ . What fraction of the soccer league is now female?

$\text{(A) }\frac{1}{3} \qquad \text{(B) }\frac{4}{11} \qquad \text{(C) }\frac{2}{5} \qquad \text{(D) }\frac{4}{9} \qquad \text{(E) }\frac{1}{2}$

## Solution 1
Let the amount of soccer players last year be $x$ , the number of male players last year to be $m$ , and the number of females players last year to be $f.$ We want to find $\frac{1.2f}{1.1x},$ since that's the fraction of female players now. From the problem, we are given
\begin{align*} x&=m+f \\ 1.1x&=1.05m+1.2f \\ \end{align*}
Eliminating $m$ and solving for $\frac{1.2f}{1.1x}$ gives us our answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac {4}{11}}.$
