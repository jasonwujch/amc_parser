## Problem

The War of $1812$ started with a declaration of war on Thursday, June $18$ , $1812$ . The peace treaty to end the war was signed $919$ days later, on December $24$ , $1814$ . On what day of the week was the treaty signed?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{Friday} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \text{Saturday} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \text{Sunday} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \text{Monday} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \text{Tuesday}$

## Solution
By: dragonfly
To find what day of the week it is in $919$ days, we have to divide $919$ by $7$ to see the remainder, and then add the remainder to the current day. We get that $\frac{919}{7}$ has a remainder of 2, so we increase the current day by $2$ to get $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \text{Saturday}}$ .
Note that the dates themselves (and thus leap years) can be ignored, as we only need the number of days that passed to figure out the day of the week.

## Solution 2 (Highly not recommended)
$1812$ is a leap year (divisible by $4$ , but not divisible by $100$ unless divisible by $400$ ), but June is after February so there are no leap days that need to be accounted for.
Since $365 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$ , the same day after $1$ year is $1$ weekday ahead. Since $30 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$ and $31 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$ , the same day after $30$ / $31$ days is $2$ / $3$ weekdays ahead.
- $2$ years ( $2$ weekdays) passed, reaching June $18$ , $1812$ .
- June $18$ - $30$ and July $1$ - $17$ ( $30$ days or $2$ weekdays) passed, reaching July $18$ .
- July $18$ - $31$ and August $1$ - $17$ ( $31$ days or $3$ weekdays) passed, reaching August $18$ .
- August-September ( $3$ weekdays) passed.
- September-October ( $2$ weekdays) passed.
- October-November ( $3$ weekdays) passed.
- November-December ( $2$ weekdays) passed, reaching December $18$ .
- $6$ days passed, reaching December $24$ .
This gives a total of $2+2+3+3+2+3+2+6 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$ weekdays passing, which gets from Thursday to $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \text{Saturday}}$ . ~ emerald_block

## Solution 3 (Doomsday)
Since doomsday of $2000$ is $2$ (Tuesday) and $2000$ is a multiple of $400$ , counting down by $100$ -year intervals gets that doomsday of $1800$ is $2+1+2 \equiv 5$ . Counting up by $4$ -year intervals, doomsday of $1812$ is $5-3\cdot2 \equiv 6$ . Doomsday of $1814$ is then $6+2\cdot1 \equiv 1$ , so December 12 is weekday $1$ . December 24 is then weekday $1+12 \equiv 6 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \text{Saturday}}$ . ~ emerald_block
