## Problem

What is the value of $\frac{2a^{-1}+\frac{a^{-1}}{2}}{a}$ when $a= \frac{1}{2}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{5}{2}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 20$

## Solution
By: Dragonfly
We find that $a^{-1}$ is the same as $2$ , since a number to the power of $-1$ is just the reciprocal of that number. We then get the equation to be
\[\frac{2\times2+\frac{2}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}}\]
We can then simplify the equation to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 10}$
