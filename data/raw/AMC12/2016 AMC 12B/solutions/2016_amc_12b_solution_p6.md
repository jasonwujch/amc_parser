## Problem

All three vertices of $\bigtriangleup ABC$ lie on the parabola defined by $y=x^2$ , with $A$ at the origin and $\overline{BC}$ parallel to the $x$ -axis. The area of the triangle is $64$ . What is the length of $BC$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 16$

## Solution
By: Albert471
Plotting points $B$ and $C$ on the graph shows that they are at $\left( -x,x^2\right)$ and $\left( x,x^2\right)$ , which is isosceles. By setting up the triangle area formula you get: $64=\frac{1}{2}*2x*x^2 = 64=x^3$ Making x=4, and the length of $BC$ is $2x$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 8}$ .
