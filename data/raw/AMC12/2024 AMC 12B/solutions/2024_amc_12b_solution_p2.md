## Problem

What is $10! - 7! \cdot 6!$

## Solution 1
$10! = 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7! = 720 \cdot 7!$
$6! \cdot 7! = 720 \cdot 7!$
Therefore, the equation is equal to $720 \cdot 7! - 720 \cdot 7! = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0}$
[ONLY FOR CERTAIN CHINESE TESTPAPERS]
$0 - 5! = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }-120}$

## Solution 2
Factoring out $7!$ gives \[7!(10\cdot9\cdot8-1\cdot6!).\] Since $10\cdot9\cdot8=6!=720$ , the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B) }0}$
Factoring $6!$ also works, it just makes the expression in the parenthesis a little harder to compute.

## Solution 3
Note that $10! - 7! \cdot 6!$ must be divisible by $7$ , and $\boxed{\text{(B) }0}$ is the only option divisible by $7$ .

## Solution 4
$10! - 7! \cdot 6!$ can be split into two parts, $10!$ and $7! \cdot 6!$ . We can break the $6!$ into $(2 \cdot 4)(3 \cdot 5 \cdot 6)$ The $2 \cdot 4$ part makes $8$ , and the $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 6$ part makes $90$ , which is $9 \cdot 10$ . We still have the 7!, and we can multiply it by $8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10$ . This is clearly equivalent to $10!$ , so our solution is $10! - 10! =$ $\boxed{\text{(B) }0}$ .

## Solution 5
$10! = 3,628,800$ , $7! = 5,040$ , and $6! = 720$ . Of course, if you're fast enough, you can do $5,040 \cdot 720 = 3,628,800$ . Therefore, $3,628,800 - 3,628,800 = \boxed{\text{(B) }0}$ .
