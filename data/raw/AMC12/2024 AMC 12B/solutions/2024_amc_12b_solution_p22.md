## Problem

Let $\triangle{ABC}$ be a triangle with integer side lengths and the property that $\angle{B} = 2\angle{A}$ . What is the least possible perimeter of such a triangle?

$\textbf{(A) }13 \qquad \textbf{(B) }14 \qquad \textbf{(C) }15 \qquad \textbf{(D) }16 \qquad \textbf{(E) }17 \qquad$

## Solution 1
Let $AB=c$ , $BC=a$ , $AC=b$ . According to the law of sines, \[\frac{b}{a}=\frac{\sin \angle B}{\sin \angle A}=2\cos \angle A\]
According to the law of cosines, \[\cos \angle A=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\]
Hence, \[\frac{b}{a}=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{bc}\]
This simplifies to $b^2=a(a+c)$ . We want to find the positive integer solution $(a, b, c)$ to this equation such that $a, b, c$ forms a triangle, and $a+b+c$ is minimized. We proceed by casework on the value of $b$ . Remember that $a<a+c$ .
Case $1$ : $b=1$
Clearly, this case yields no valid solutions.
Case $2$ : $b=2$
For this case, we must have $a=1$ and $c=3$ . However, $(1, 2, 3)$ does not form a triangle. Hence this case yields no valid solutions.
Case $3$ : $b=3$
For this case, we must have $a=1$ and $c=8$ . However, $(1, 3, 8)$ does not form a triangle. Hence this case yields no valid solutions.
Case $4$ : $b=4$
For this case, $a=1$ and $c=15$ , or $a=2$ and $c=6$ . As one can check, this case also yields no valid solutions
Case $5$ : $b=5$
For this case, we must have $a=1$ and $c=24$ . There are no valid solutions
Case $6$ : $b=6$
For this case, $a=2$ and $c=16$ , or $a=4$ and $c=5$ , or $a=3$ and $c=9$ . The only valid solution for this case is $(4, 6, 5)$ , which yields a perimeter of $15$ .
When $b\ge 7$ , it is easy to see that $a+c>7$ . Hence $a+b+c>14$ , which means $a+b+c\ge15$ . Therefore, the answer is $\fbox{\textbf{(C) }15}$

## Solution 2 (Similar to Solution 1)
Let $\overline{BC}=a$ , $\overline{AC}=b$ , $\overline{AB}=c$ . Extend $C$ to point $D$ on $\overline{AB}$ such that $\angle ACD = \angle CAD$ . This means $\triangle CDA$ is isosceles, so $CD=DA$ . Since $\angle CDB$ is the exterior angle of $\triangle CDA$ , we have \[\angle CDB=m+m=2m=\angle CBD.\] Thus, $\triangle CBD$ is isosceles, so $CB=CD=DA=a.$ Then, draw the altitude of $\triangle CBD$ , from $C$ to $\overline{BD}$ , and let this point be $H$ . Let $BH=HD=x$ . Then, by Pythagorean Theorem, \begin{align*} CH^2&=a^2-x^2 \\ CH^2&= b^2 - (c+x)^2.\\ \end{align*} Thus, \[a^2-x^2=b^2-(c-x)^2.\] Solving for $x$ , we have $x=\frac{a^2-b^2+c^2}{2c}.$ Since $2x=c-a$ , we have \[c-a=\frac{a^2-b^2+c^2}{c},\] and simplifying, we get $b^2=a^2+ac.$ Now we can consider cases on what $a$ is. (Note: Although there looks to be quite a few cases, they are just trivial and usually only take up to a few seconds max).
Case $1$ : $a=1$ .
This means $b^2=c+1$ , so the least possible values are $b=2$ , $c=3$ , but this does not work as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. Similarly, $b=3$ , $c=8$ also does not satisfy it. Anything larger goes beyond the answer choices, so we stop checking this case.
Case $2$ : $a=2$ This means $b^2=2c+4$ , so the least possible values for $b$ and $c$ are $b=4$ , $c=6$ , but this does not satisfy the triangle inequality, and anything larger does not satisfy the answer choices.
Case $3$ : $a=3$ This means $b^2=3c+9$ , and the least possible value for $b$ is $b=6$ , which occurs when $c=9$ . Unfortunately, this also does not satisfy the triangle inequality, and similarly, any $b > 6$ means the perimeter will get too big.
Case $4$ : $a=4$ This means $b^2=4c+16$ , so we have $b=6,c=5,a=4$ , so the least possible perimeter so far is $4+5+6=15$ .
Case $5$ : $a=5$ We have $b^2=5c+25$ , so least possible value for $b$ is $b=10$ , which already does not work as $a=5$ , and the minimum perimeter is $15$ already.
Case $6$ : $a=6$ We have $b^2=6c+36$ , so $b=10$ , which already does not work.
Then, notice that when $a\geq 7$ , we also must have $b\geq8$ and $c\geq1$ , so $a+b+c \geq 16$ , so the least possible perimeter is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}.$

## Solution 3 (Trigonometry)
\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}\] \[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(2A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(\pi- 3A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(3A)}\] \[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{2\sin(A)\cos(A)} = \frac{c}{3\sin(A) - 4\sin^3(A)}\] \[b = 2\cos(A)a\] \[c = (3 - 4\sin^2(A) ) a = (4\cos^2(A)-1)a\] \[A+B = A+2A < 180^{\circ}\] \[A < 60^{\circ} , \frac{1}{2} < cos(A) < 1\]
\[a:b:c = 1: 2\cos(A) : 4\cos^2(A)-1\] $\cos(A)$ must be rational, let's evaluate some small values
case #1: $\cos(A) = \frac{1}{2}$ invalid since = $\frac{1}{2}$
case #2: $\cos(A) = \frac{1}{3}$ invalid since < $\frac{1}{2}$
case #3: $\cos(A) = \frac{2}{3}$ give ${1: \frac{4}{3} : \frac{7}{9} }$ with side $9:12:7$ , perimeter = 28
case #4: $\cos(A) = \frac{1}{4}$ invalid since < $\frac{1}{2}$
case #5: $\cos(A) = \frac{3}{4}$ give ${1: \frac{3}{2} : \frac{5}{4} }$ with side $4:6:5$ , perimeter = 15
case #6: $\cos(A) = \frac{3}{5}$ give ${1: \frac{6}{5} : \frac{11}{25} }$ with side $25:30:11$
case #7: $\cos(A) = \frac{4}{5}$ give ${1: \frac{8}{5} : \frac{39}{25} }$ with side $25:40:39$
case #8: $\cos(A) = \frac{4}{6}$ same as $\frac{2}{3}$
case #9: $\cos(A) = \frac{5}{6}$ give ${1: \frac{5}{3} : \frac{16}{9} }$ with side (9:15:16)
case #10: when $a \geq 7, b =2cos(A)*a > 2* \frac{1}{2}*7 = 7 , a+b+c > 15$
$\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}$

## Solution 4
Draw the circumcircle of $\triangle{ABC}$ and let the angle bisector of $\angle{B}$ meet the circle at $D$
By fact 5 we have $CD=AD, \angle{CBD}=\angle{ABD}=\angle{CAB}=\angle{DAC}, \angle{CBA}=\angle{DAB}$ , thus $AC=BD, CD=CB$
By Ptolemy, we have $c^2=(a+b)CD, CD=\frac{c^2}{a+b}=a, a^2+ab=c^2$ . Try some numbers and the answer is $(4,5,6)\implies \boxed{15}$

## Solution 5
Let $\angle A=\theta$ , then $\angle B=2\theta$ .
Find $D$ on $AB$ such that $\angle ACD=\theta$ . Thus, $\angle CDB=\angle A+\angle ACD=2\theta$ . So $AD=CD=BD$ .
Find $E$ on $BD$ such that $CE\perp BD$ . Apparently, this gives $E$ as the mid-point of $BD$ .
Let the length of $BC$ be $x$ . Then $AB$ can be expressed as $AD+BD=AD+2BE=x+2x\cos 2\theta$ .
Since $CE=x\sin 2\theta$ , the length of $AC$ can be expressed as $2x\cos\theta$ (using double angle formula).
Now we need to determine the range of $\theta$ .
The above conditions are only valid if $\angle B$ is an acute angle.(the strict proof will be shown in the end*) So $\theta<45^\circ$ , this yields $\cos\theta\in\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},1\right)$ .
Let $\cos\theta=\frac{p}{q}$ , where $(p,q)=1$ .
To minimize the perimeter, the denominator needs to be as small as possible. In this way, a small $x$ can be used to integrate the side length.
Test $q=2$ , $\frac{1}{2}$ is not in the range.
Test $q=3$ , $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$ are not in the range (since $0.67<0.71$ ).
Test $q=4$ , $\frac{3}{4}$ is in the range. In this case, the smallest $x$ that make side length integer is $4$ , since the side length is $x$ , $\frac{5}{4}x$ and $\frac{3}{2}x$ So the perimeter is $4+5+6=15$ .
So $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}$ is the correct answer.
When $q$ becomes bigger, a larger $x$ is required to integrate the length, thus cannot give the minimum perimeter.
If $\angle B>90^\circ$ , $\angle A+\angle B>135^\circ$ ,then $\angle C<45^\circ$ . This will result in point D on the extension of AB, meaning that $\angle CDB+\angle CBD<180^\circ$ . Hence, $2\angle B<180^\circ$ , $\angle B<90^\circ$ , which contradicts our condition. If $\angle B=90^\circ$ ,The triangle is isosceles right triangle. So, the ratio of sides is $1:1:\sqrt{2}$ , which, obviously means the length cannot be all integers.

## Solution 6
Extend the angle bisector of $\angle B$ to point $P$ on $\overline{AC}.$ We have $\triangle BPC \sim ABC,$ so $\frac{m}{b} = \frac{b}{c},$ yielding $m = \frac{b^2}{c}.$ By the angle bisector theorem, $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{m}{n},$ so $\frac{ma}{b} = \frac{ab}{c} = n$ after substitution. We also have $m + n = c,$ so \[\frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{ab}{c} = c \implies b^2 + ab = b(b + a) = c^2,\] for $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}.$ We can't have $b=1$ for any integral triangle. If $b = 2$ then $2a + 4 = c^2$ , which gives $c = 4$ and $a = 6,$ which fails the triangle inequality. If $b=3$ then $a = 9$ and $c = 6$ , which fails again. If $b = 4$ , then $(a, c) = (5, 6)$ , which works and yields a perimeter of $15$ . If $b=5$ , then $(a, c) = (15, 10),$ and if $b = 6$ , then $(a, c) = (18, 12),$ which fails again.
If $b \geq 7$ then $a+b>7,$ yielding a minimum perimeter of $\boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 15}},$ which was already achieved.

## Solution 7 (No Casework, Trig)
Let $AB=c$ , $BC=a$ , $AC=b$ .
Our goal is to find
\[\min_{a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}} a+b+c\]
By the law of sines,
\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}\]
Substituting $B=2A$ and $C = 180^\circ - A - B$ :
\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(2A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(180^\circ-3A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(3A)}\]
We will attempt to cancel the $\sin(A)$ factor in the denominator. Using multiple-angle trigonometric identities,
\[\sin(2A) = 2\sin(A)\cos(A)\] \[\sin(3A) = \sin(A)(4\cos^2(A)-1)\]
we obtain:
\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{2\sin(A)\cos(A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(A)(4\cos^2(A)-1))}\]
which simplifies to:
\[a = \frac{b}{2\cos(A)} = \frac{c}{(4\cos^2(A)-1))}\]
We notice that the term $2\cos(A)$ appears multiple times. For convenience, let $t:=2\cos(A)$ . Then, rewriting $b$ and $c$ in terms of $a$ , we get:
\[b=ta\] \[c=(t^2-1)a\]
We now rewrite the original goal in terms of $t$ and $a$ . Notice that since $a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}$ , then the perimeter $a+b+c \in \mathbb{N}$ . Hence,
\[a+b+c = a + ta + (t^2-1)a\] \[= at(t+1) \in \mathbb{N}\]
This means that $t \in \mathbb{Q}$ , so let $t := \frac{m}{n}$ with $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$ . To minimize
\[a+b+c = at(t+1) = a\left(\frac{m^2}{n^2}+\frac{m}{n}\right)\]
we set $a = n^2$ to ensure the perimeter is an integer, and the objective becomes
\[\min_{m,n \in \mathbb{N}} m(m+n)\]
Notice that to have a valid triangle, $c=(t^2-1)a>0$ implies $t^2 - 1 > 0$ so $t > 1$ .
In addition, due to the triangle inequality, we must have $c < a + b$ , such that
\[(t^2-1)a < a + ta\]
Since $a>0$ , we can safely divide through, yielding $t > 2$ . Overall, we have $1<t<2$ , or equivalently, $n<m<2n$ . The smallest pair satisfying this condition is $n=2$ , $m=3$ , yielding a perimeter of $15$ . (Notice, to have a valid integer between $n$ and $2n$ , there must be a gap of at least $1$ in between, implying $2n-n-1=n-1\ge 1$ , so setting $n=2$ yields the minimum.) Increasing $m$ or $n$ will increase the perimeter, so this is the global minimum. Hence the answer is:
\[\boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 15}}\]
