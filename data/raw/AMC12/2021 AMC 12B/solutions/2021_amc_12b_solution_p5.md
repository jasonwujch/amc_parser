# 2021 AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

The point $P(a,b)$ in the $xy$ -plane is first rotated counterclockwise by $90^\circ$ around the point $(1,5)$ and then reflected about the line $y = -x$ . The image of $P$ after these two transformations is at $(-6,3)$ . What is $b - a ?$

$\textbf{(A)} ~1 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~3 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~5 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~7 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~9$

## Solution 1 (Transformation Rules)
The final image of $P$ is $(-6,3)$ . We know the reflection rule for reflecting over $y=-x$ is $(x,y) \rightarrow (-y, -x)$ . So before the reflection and after rotation the point is $(-3,6)$ .
By definition of rotation, the slope between $(-3,6)$ and $(1,5)$ must be perpendicular to the slope between $(a,b)$ and $(1,5)$ . The first slope is $\frac{5-6}{1-(-3)} = \frac{-1}{4}$ . This means the slope of $P$ and $(1,5)$ is $4$ .
Rotations also preserve distance to the center of rotation, and since we only "travelled" up and down by the slope once to get from $(-3,6)$ to $(1,5)$ it follows we shall only use the slope once to travel from $(1,5)$ to $P$ .
Therefore point $P$ is located at $(1+1, 5+4) = (2,9)$ . The answer is $9-2 = 7 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ .

## Solution 2 (Complex Numbers)
Let us reconstruct that coordinate plane as the complex plane. Then, the point $P(a, b)$ becomes $a+b\cdot{i}$ . A $90^\circ$ rotation around the point $(1, 5)$ can be done by translating the point $(1, 5)$ to the origin, rotating around the origin by $90^\circ$ , and then translating the origin back to the point $(1, 5)$ . \[a+b\cdot{i} \implies (a-1)+(b-5)\cdot{i} \implies ((a-1)+(b-5)\cdot{i})\cdot{i} = 5-b+(a-1)i \implies 5+1-b+(a-1+5)i = 6-b+(a+4)i.\] By basis reflection rules, the reflection of $(-6, 3)$ about the line $y = -x$ is $(-3, 6)$ . Hence, we have \[6-b+(a+4)i = -3+6i \implies b=9, a=2,\] from which $b-a = 9-2 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ .

## Solution 3 (Reverso)
The problem gives a series of transformations and proceeds to give the resultant point, being $(-6,3)=P$ . Therefore, all we must do is reverse it. First, we reverse the last transformation by computing the distance from the point $(-6,3)$ to $y=-x$ by using the formula $d=\frac{|Ax+By+C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$ . Where $Ax+By+C$ is the standard form of a line. Computing, we obtain that $d=\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . We also know that this is magnitude is at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$ . Therefore, to do the transformation, we double that vector and add it to the point. We get:
$P^{'}=P+2\overrightarrow{v}$ $\implies P'=(-6,3)+\left\langle 3\sqrt{2}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},3\sqrt{2}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right \rangle$ $\implies P'=(-3,6)$ .
Now, we must reverse the second transformation. To do so, realize that $P'-(1,5)\Leftrightarrow \overrightarrow{v_{2}}=\left\langle -4,1 \right\rangle$ . Simply make this vector perpendicular by switching the $x$ and $y$ components and switching the sign of the initial $y$ component. Therefore, we get $\overrightarrow{v_{2\bot }}=\left\langle 1,4 \right\rangle$ . Therefore, adding this vector to $(1,5)$ yields $(2,9)$ , which leads us to $9-2 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ .

## Solution 4 (Vector Dot Product)
Using the same method as in Solution 1, we can obtain that the point before the reflection is $(-3,6)$ . If we let the original point be $(x, y)$ , then we can use that the starting point is $(1,5)$ to obtain two vectors $\langle -4,1 \rangle$ and $\langle x-1, y-5 \rangle$ . We know that two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is equal to $0$ , and that both points are the same distance ( $\sqrt {17}$ ) from $(1,5)$ .
Therefore, we can write two equations using these vectors: $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 17$ (from distance and pythagorean theorem) and $-4x+y-1 = 0$ (from dot product)
Solving, we simplify the second equation to $y=4x+1$ , and plug it into the first equation. We obtain $(x-1)^2 + (4x-4)^2 = 17$ . We can simplify this to the quadratic $17x^2-34x=0$ . When we factor out $17x$ , we find that $x = 2$ or $x = 0$ . However, $x$ cannot equal $0$ . Therefore, $x = 2$ , and plugging this into the second equation gives us that $y = 9$ . Since the point is $(9, 2)$ , we compute $9-2 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ .

## Solution 5 (Vector Dot Product scuffed version)
Using the same method as in Solution 1 reflecting $(-6,3)$ about the line $y = -x$ gives us $(-3,6).$
Let the original point be $\langle x,y \rangle.$ From point $(1,5),$ we form the vectors $\langle -4,1 \rangle$ and $\langle x-1, y-5 \rangle$ that extend out from the initial point. If they are perpendicular, we know that their dot product has to equal zero. Therefore, \[\langle -4,1 \rangle \cdot \langle x-1, y-5 \rangle = 0 \implies -4x+y-1= 0.\] Now, we have to do some guess and check from the multiple choices. Let $y - x = A$ where $A$ is one of the answer choices. Then, $A -3x = 1.$ By intuition and logical reasoning we deduce that $A$ must be $1 \pmod 3$ so that brings our potential answers down to $\text{\textbf{(A)}}$ and $\text{\textbf{(C)}}.$ If $A = 1$ from $\text{\textbf{(A)}},$ then $x = 0,$ which we can quickly rule out since we know thar $P$ rotated counterclockwise not clockwise. Hence, $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ is the answer.

## Solution 6 (Working Backwards Approach, Super Easy!)
The last thing that happened was the reflection over the line $y = -x$ , so we reverse that by reflecting $(-6,3)$ over $y = -x$ to get $(-3,6)$ . Now, we have to rotate it $\textbf{clockwise}$ , to reverse the first step. To rotate $(-3,6)$ over the point $(1,5)$ clockwise 90 degrees, we can subtract $1$ from each x-coordinate and subtract $5$ from each y-coordinate. That way, we only have to rotate $(-4,1)$ clockwise 90 degrees over the origin $(0,0)$ . This is pretty easy to do in your head, so you get $(1,4)$ . But we are not, done, we still have to add $1$ to each x-coordinate and add $5$ to each y-coordinate, to get $(2,9)$ , so our final answer is $9 - 2 = 7$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~7}$ .
