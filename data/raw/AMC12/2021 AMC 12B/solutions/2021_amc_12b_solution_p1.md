## Problem

How many integer values of $x$ satisfy $|x|<3\pi$ ?

$\textbf{(A)} ~9 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~10 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~18 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~19 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~20$

## Solution 1
Since $3\pi\approx9.42$ , we multiply $9$ by $2$ for the integers from $1$ to $9$ and the integers from $-1$ to $-9$ and add $1$ to account for $0$ to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~19}$ .

## Solution 2
$|x|<3\pi$ $\iff$ $-3\pi<x<3\pi$ . Since $\pi$ is approximately $3.14$ , $3\pi$ is approximately $9.42$ . We are trying to solve for $-9.42<x<9.42$ , where $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Hence, $-9.42<x<9.42$ $\implies$ $-9\leq x\leq9$ , for $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ . The number of integer values of $x$ is $9-(-9)+1=19$ . Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~19}$ .

## Solution 3
$3\pi \approx 9.4.$ There are two cases here.
When $x>0, |x|>0,$ and $x = |x|.$ So then $x<9.4$
When $x<0, |x|>0,$ and $x = -|x|.$ So then $-x<9.4$ . Dividing by $-1$ and flipping the sign, we get $x>-9.4.$
From case 1 and 2, we know that $-9.4 < x < 9.4$ . Since $x$ is an integer, we must have $x$ between $-9$ and $9$ . There are a total of \[9-(-9) + 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~19} \text{ integers}.\] ~ PureSwag

## Solution 4
Looking at the problem, we see that instead of directly saying $x$ , we see that it is $|x|.$ That means all the possible values of $x$ in this case are positive and negative. Rounding $\pi$ to $3$ we get $3(3)=9.$ There are $9$ positive solutions and $9$ negative solutions: $9+9=18.$ But what about zero? Even though zero is neither negative nor positive, but we still need to add it into the solution. Hence, the answer is $9+9+1=18+1=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~19}.$

## Solution 5
There are an odd number of integer solutions $x$ to this inequality since if any non-zero integer $x$ satisfies this inequality, then so does $-x,$ and we must also account for $0,$ which gives us the desired. Then, the answer is either $\textbf{(A)}$ or $\textbf{(D)},$ and since $3 \pi > 3 \cdot 3 > 9,$ the answer is at least $9 \cdot 2 + 1 = 19,$ yielding $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~19}.$
