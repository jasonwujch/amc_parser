## Solution 1 (Analytic Geometry)
Toss on the Cartesian plane with $A=(5, 12), B=(0, 0),$ and $C=(14, 0)$ . Then $\overline{AD}\parallel\overline{BC}, \overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CE}$ by the trapezoid condition, where $D, E\in\overline{BP}$ . Since $PC=10$ , point $P$ is $\tfrac{10}{15}=\tfrac{2}{3}$ of the way from $C$ to $A$ and is located at $(8, 8)$ . Thus line $BP$ has equation $y=x$ . Since $\overline{AD}\parallel\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the ground, we know $D$ has the same $y$ -coordinate as $A$ , except it'll also lie on the line $y=x$ . Therefore, $D=(12, 12). \, \blacksquare$
To find the location of point $E$ , we need to find the intersection of $y=x$ with a line parallel to $\overline{AB}$ passing through $C$ . The slope of this line is the same as the slope of $\overline{AB}$ , or $\tfrac{12}{5}$ , and has equation $y=\tfrac{12}{5}x-\tfrac{168}{5}$ . The intersection of this line with $y=x$ is $(24, 24)$ . Therefore point $E$ is located at $(24, 24). \, \blacksquare$
The distance $DE$ is equal to the distance between $(12, 12)$ and $(24, 24)$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }12\sqrt2}$ .

## Solution 2 (Stewart's Theorem)
Using Stewart's Theorem we find $BP = 8\sqrt{2}$ . From the similar triangles $BPA\sim EPC$ and $BPC\sim DPA$ , we have \[DP = BP\cdot\frac{PA}{PC} = \frac{1}{2}BP\] \[EP = BP\cdot\frac{PC}{PA} = 2BP\] So, \[DE = \frac{3}{2}BP = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }12\sqrt2}.\]

## Solution 3
Let $x$ be the length $PE$ . From the similar triangles $BPA\sim EPC$ and $BPC\sim DPA$ we have \[BP = \frac{PA}{PC}x = \frac12 x\] \[PD = \frac{PA}{PC}BP = \frac14 x\] Therefore $BD = DE = \frac{3}{4}x$ . Now extend line $CD$ to the point $Z$ on $AE$ , forming parallelogram $ZABC$ . As $BD = DE$ we also have $EZ = ZC = 13$ so $EC = 26$ .
We now use the Law of Cosines to find $x$ (the length of $PE$ ): \[x^2 = EC^2 + PC^2 - 2(EC)(PC)\cos{(PCE)} = 26^2 + 10^2 - 2\cdot 26\cdot 10\cos(\angle PCE)\] As $\angle PCE = \angle BAC$ , we have (by Law of Cosines on triangle $BAC$ ) \[\cos(\angle PCE) = \frac{13^2 + 15^2 - 14^2}{2\cdot 13\cdot 15}.\] Therefore \begin{align*} x^2 &= 26^2 + 10^2 - 2\cdot 26\cdot 10\cdot\frac{198}{2\cdot 13\cdot 15}\\ &= 776 - 264\\ &= 512 \end{align*} And $x = 16\sqrt2$ . The answer is then $\frac34x = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }12\sqrt2}$ .

## Solution 4 (Heron's Formula, Pythagorean Theorem, Similar Triangles)
Let the brackets denote areas. By Heron's Formula, we have \begin{align*} [ABC]&=\sqrt{\frac{13+14+15}{2}\left(\frac{13+14+15}{2}-13\right)\left(\frac{13+14+15}{2}-14\right)\left(\frac{13+14+15}{2}-15\right)} \\ &=\sqrt{21\left(21-13\right)\left(21-14\right)\left(21-15\right)} \\ &=\sqrt{21\left(8\right)\left(7\right)\left(6\right)} \\ &=\sqrt{\left(3\cdot7\right)\left(2^3\right)\left(7\right)\left(2\cdot3\right)} \\ &=2^2\cdot3\cdot7 \\ &=84. \end{align*} It follows that the height of $ABCD$ is $\frac{2[ABC]}{14}=12.$
Next, we drop the altitudes $\overline{AF}$ and $\overline{DG}$ of $ABCD.$ By the Pythagorean Theorem on right $\triangle AFB,$ we get $BF=5.$ By the AA Similarity, we have $\triangle ADP\sim\triangle CBP,$ with the ratio of similitude $1:2.$ It follows that $AD=7.$ Since $ADGF$ is a rectangle, we get $FG=AD=7.$ By the Pythagorean Theorem on right $\triangle DGB,$ we get $BD=12\sqrt2.$
By $\triangle ADP\sim\triangle CBP$ again, we get $BP=8\sqrt2$ and $DP=4\sqrt2.$ Also, by the AA Similarity, we have $\triangle ABP\sim\triangle CEP,$ with the ratio of similitude $1:2.$ It follows that $EP=16\sqrt2.$
Finally, we obtain $DE=EP-DP=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }12\sqrt2}.$
Remark
It is well known that the area of a $13\text{-}14\text{-}15$ triangle is $84.$

## Solution 5 (Barycentric Coordinates)
(For those unfamiliar with barycentric coordinates, consider reading the barycentric coordinates article written by Evan Chen and Max Schindler here: https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Resources_for_mathematics_competitions#Articles )
We can find $P$ in barycentric coordinates as $\Bigr(\frac{2}{3},0,\frac{1}{3}\Bigr)$ . We can then write $\overline{BP}$ as $x-2z=0$ , where $(x,y,z)$ defines a point in barycentric coordinates. We have $\overline{AD}\parallel \overline{BC}$ as $y+z=0$ and $\overline{CE}\parallel \overline{AB}$ as $x+y=0$ . We can then compute $D$ and $E$ by intersecting lines: \[\begin{cases} x-2z=0\\ y+z=0\\ x+y+z=1 \end{cases}\] Which gives us $D=\left(1, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ . We can get $E$ with: \[\begin{cases} x-2z=0\\ x+y=0\\ x+y+z=1 \end{cases}\] Which gives us $E=(2, -2, 1)$ . Then, finding the displacement vector, we have $\overrightarrow{ED}=\left(1,-\frac{3}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)$ . Using the barycentric distance formula: \begin{align*} \text{dist}(D,E)&=\sqrt{-a^2yx-b^2zx-c^2xy} \\ &=\sqrt{-14^2\Bigr(-\frac{3}{2}\Bigr)\Bigr(\frac{1}{2}\Bigr)-15^2\Bigr(1\Bigr)\Bigr(\frac{1}{2}\Bigr)-13^2\Bigr(-\frac{3}{2}\Bigr)\Bigr(\frac{1}{2}\Bigr)} \\ &=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }12\sqrt2}. \end{align*}
