# 2021 AMC 12B Problem 12

## Problem

Suppose that $S$ is a finite set of positive integers. If the greatest integer in $S$ is removed from $S$ , then the average value (arithmetic mean) of the integers remaining is $32$ . If the least integer in $S$ is also removed, then the average value of the integers remaining is $35$ . If the greatest integer is then returned to the set, the average value of the integers rises to $40$ . The greatest integer in the original set $S$ is $72$ greater than the least integer in $S$ . What is the average value of all the integers in the set $S$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }36.2 \qquad \textbf{(B) }36.4 \qquad \textbf{(C) }36.6\qquad \textbf{(D) }36.8 \qquad \textbf{(E) }37$

## Solution 1
We can then say that \( \frac{A+S(n)}{n+1} = 32 \), \( \frac{S(n)}{n} = 35 \), and \( \frac{B+S(n)}{n+1} = 40 \).
Expanding gives us \( A+S(n) = 32n+32 \), \( S(n) = 35n \), and \( B+S(n) = 40n+40 \).
Substituting \( S(n) = 35n \) to all gives us \( A+35n=32n+32 \) and \( B+35n=40n+40 \).
Solving for \( A \) and \( B \) gives \( A=-3n+32 \) and \( B = 5n+40 \).
We now need to find \( \frac{S(n)+A+B}{n+2} \). We substitute everything to get \( \frac{35n+(-3n+32)+(5n+40)}{n+2} \), or \( \frac{37n+72}{n+2} \).
Say that the answer to this is \( Z \). Then, \( Z \) needs to be a number that makes \( n \) a positive integer. The only options that work is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }36.6}$ and $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }36.8}$ .
However, if 36.6 is an option, we get \( n=3 \). So that means that \(A\) is \(23\) and \(B\) is \(55\), and \( S(n)=105 \). But if there is \(3\) terms, then the middle number is \(105\), but we said that \( B \) is the largest number in the set, so therefore our answer cannot be $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }36.6}$ and is instead $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }36.8}$ and now, we're finished!

## Solution 1 Alternative Ending
If A is smaller than B by 72 therefore from the equation on the top you can find out that \(N = 8\) using substitution the plug it in to the equation \( \frac{37n+72}{n+2} \) then you will get that Z = $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }36.8}$ .
This was more efficient then the last part.

## Solution 2
Let the lowest value be $L$ and the highest $G$ , and let the sum be $Z$ and the amount of numbers $n$ . We have $\frac{Z-G}{n-1}=32$ , $\frac{Z-L-G}{n-2}=35$ , $\frac{Z-L}{n-1}=40$ , and $G=L+72$ . Clearing denominators gives $Z-G=32n-32$ , $Z-L-G=35n-70$ , and $Z-L=40n-40$ . We use $G=L+72$ to turn the first equation into $Z-L=32n+40$ . Since $Z-L=40(n-1)$ we substitute it into the equation which gives $n=10$ . Turning the second into $Z-2L=35n+2$ using $G=L+72$ we see $L=8$ and $Z=368$ so the average is $\frac{Z}{n}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }36.8}$ ~aop2014

## Solution 3
Let $x$ be the greatest integer, $y$ be the smallest, $z$ be the sum of the numbers in S excluding $x$ and $y$ , and $k$ be the number of elements in S.
Then, $S=x+y+z$
First, when the greatest integer is removed, $\frac{S-x}{k-1}=32$
When the smallest integer is also removed, $\frac{S-x-y}{k-2}=35$
When the greatest integer is added back, $\frac{S-y}{k-1}=40$
We are given that $x=y+72$
After you substitute $x=y+72$ , you have 3 equations with 3 unknowns $S,$ , $y$ and $k$ .
$S-y-72=32k-32$
$S-2y-72=35k-70$
$S-y=40k-40$
This can be easily solved to yield $k=10$ , $y=8$ , $S=368$ .
$\therefore$ average value of all integers in the set $=S/k = 368/10 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }36.8}$

## Solution 4
We should plug in $36.2$ and assume everything is true except the $35$ part. We then calculate that part and end up with $35.75$ . We also see with the formulas we used with the plug in that when you increase by $0.2$ the $35.75$ part decreases by $0.25$ . The answer is then $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }36.8}$ . You can work backwards because it is multiple choice and you don't have to do critical thinking. ~Lopkiloinm

## Solution 5
Let $S = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \hdots, a_n\}$ with $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \hdots < a_n.$ We are given the following: \[{\begin{cases} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i = 32(n-1) = 32n-32, \\ \sum_{i=2}^n a_i = 40(n-1) = 40n-40, \\ \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_i = 35(n-2) = 35n-70, \\ a_n-a_1 = 72 \implies a_1 + 72 = a_n. \end{cases}}\] Subtracting the third equation from the sum of the first two, we find that \[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \left(32n-32\right) + \left(40n-40\right) - \left(35n-70\right) = 37n - 2.\] Furthermore, from the fourth equation, we have \[\sum_{i=2}^{n} a_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i = \left[\left(a_1 + 72\right) + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_i\right] - \left[\left(a_1\right) + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_i\right] = \left(40n-40\right)-\left(32n-32\right).\] Combining like terms and simplifying, we have \[72 = 8n-8 \implies 8n = 80 \implies n=10.\] Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is $37 \cdot 10 - 2 = 368,$ and since there are 10 elements in $S,$ the average of the elements in $S$ is $\tfrac{368}{10}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }36.8}$

## Solution 6
Let $n$ be the number of elements in $S, m_l = 32, \Sigma_l = m_l \cdot (n-1), m_g = 40, \Sigma_g = m_g \cdot (n-1), m_{lg} = 35, \Sigma_lg = m_{lg} \cdot (n-2).$ \[\Sigma_g - \Sigma_l = 72 = (n-1) \cdot (m_g - m_l) \implies n = 1 + \frac {72}{m_g - m_l} = 1 + \frac {72}{40-32}=10.\] \[m = \frac {\Sigma_g + \Sigma_l - \Sigma_{lg}}{n} = \frac {40 \cdot 9 + 32 \cdot 9 - 35 \cdot 8}{10} = 36.8.\] vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss
