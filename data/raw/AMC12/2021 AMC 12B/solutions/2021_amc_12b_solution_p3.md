## Problem

Suppose \[2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{2}{3+x}}}=\frac{144}{53}.\] What is the value of $x?$

$\textbf{(A) }\frac34 \qquad \textbf{(B) }\frac78 \qquad \textbf{(C) }\frac{14}{15} \qquad \textbf{(D) }\frac{37}{38} \qquad \textbf{(E) }\frac{52}{53}$

## Solution
Subtracting $2$ from both sides and taking reciprocals gives $1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{2}{3+x}}=\frac{53}{38}$ . Subtracting $1$ from both sides and taking reciprocals again gives $2+\frac{2}{3+x}=\frac{38}{15}$ . Subtracting $2$ from both sides and taking reciprocals for the final time gives $\frac{x+3}{2}=\frac{15}{8}$ or $x=\frac{3}{4} \implies \boxed{\text{A}}$ .
