# 2021 AMC 12B Problem 10

## Problem

Two distinct numbers are selected from the set $\{1,2,3,4,\dots,36,37\}$ so that the sum of the remaining $35$ numbers is the product of these two numbers. What is the difference of these two numbers?

$\textbf{(A) }5 \qquad \textbf{(B) }7 \qquad \textbf{(C) }8\qquad \textbf{(D) }9 \qquad \textbf{(E) }10$

## Solution
The sum of the first $n$ integers is given by $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ , so $\frac{37(37+1)}{2}=703$ .
Therefore, $703-x-y=xy$
Rearranging, $xy+x+y=703$ . We can factor this equation by SFFT to get
$(x+1)(y+1)=704$
Looking at the possible divisors of $704 = 2^6\cdot11$ , $22$ and $32$ are within the constraints of $0 < x \leq y \leq 37$ so we try those:
$(x+1)(y+1) = 22\cdot32$
$x+1=22, y+1 = 32$
$x = 21, y = 31$
Therefore, the difference $y-x=31-21=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }10}$ .
