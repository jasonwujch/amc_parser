## Problem

Let $g(x)$ be a polynomial with leading coefficient $1,$ whose three roots are the reciprocals of the three roots of $f(x)=x^3+ax^2+bx+c,$ where $1<a<b<c.$ What is $g(1)$ in terms of $a,b,$ and $c?$

$\textbf{(A) }\frac{1+a+b+c}c \qquad \textbf{(B) }1+a+b+c \qquad \textbf{(C) }\frac{1+a+b+c}{c^2}\qquad \textbf{(D) }\frac{a+b+c}{c^2} \qquad \textbf{(E) }\frac{1+a+b+c}{a+b+c}$

## Solution 1
Note that $f(1/x)$ has the same roots as $g(x)$ , if it is multiplied by some monomial so that the leading term is $x^3$ they will be equal. We have \[f(1/x) = \frac{1}{x^3} + \frac{a}{x^2}+\frac{b}{x} + c\] so we can see that \[g(x) = \frac{x^3}{c}f(1/x)\] Therefore \[g(1) = \frac{1}{c}f(1) = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{1+a+b+c}c}\]

## Solution 2 (Vieta's bash)
Let the three roots of $f(x)$ be $d$ , $e$ , and $f$ . (Here e does NOT mean 2.7182818...) We know that $a=-(d+e+f)$ , $b=de+ef+df$ , and $c=-def$ , and that $g(1)=1-\frac{1}{d}-\frac{1}{e}-\frac{1}{f}+\frac{1}{de}+\frac{1}{ef}+\frac{1}{df}-\frac{1}{def}$ (Vieta's). This is equal to $\frac{def-de-df-ef+d+e+f-1}{def}$ , which equals $\boxed{(\textbf{A}) \frac{1+a+b+c}{c}}$ . -dstanz5

## Solution 3 (Fakesolve)
Because the problem doesn't specify what the coefficients of the polynomial actually are, we can just plug in any arbitrary polynomial that satisfies the constraints. Let's take $f(x) = (x+5)^3 = x^3+15x^2+75x+125$ . Then $f(x)$ has a triple root of $x = -5$ . Then $g(x)$ has a triple root of $-\frac{1}{5}$ , and it's monic, so $g(x) = \left(x+\frac{1}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{125x^3+75x^2+15x+1}{125}$ . We can see that this is $\frac{1+a+b+c}{c}$ , which is answer choice $\boxed{(A)}$ .

## Solution 4
If we let $p, q,$ and $r$ be the roots of $f(x)$ , $f(x) = (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)$ and $g(x) = \left(x-\frac{1}{p}\right)\left(x-\frac{1}{q}\right)\left(x-\frac{1}{r}\right)$ . The requested value, $g(1)$ , is then \[\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{q}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{r}\right) = \frac{(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)}{pqr}\] The numerator is $-f(1)$ (using the product form of $f(x)$ ) and the denominator is $-c$ , so the answer is \[\frac{f(1)}{c} = \boxed{(\textbf{A}) \frac{1+a+b+c}{c}}\]

## Solution 5 (Good at Guessing)
The function $g(1) = \text{sum of coefficients}$ . If it's $(x-r)(x-s)(x-t)$ , then it becomes $(x-\dfrac{1}{r})(x-\dfrac{1}{s})(x-\dfrac{1}{t}).$ So, $-rst$ becomes $-\dfrac{1}{rst}$ , so $c$ becomes $\dfrac{1}{c}$ . Also, there is a $x^3$ so the answer must include $1$ . The only answer having both of these is $A$ .

## Solution 6
It is well known that reversing the order of the coefficients of a polynomial turns each root into its corresponding reciprocal. Thus, a polynomial with the desired roots may be written as $cx^3+bx^2+a+1$ . As the problem statement asks for a monic polynomial, our answer is \[\boxed{(\textbf{A}) \frac{1+a+b+c}{c}}\]
