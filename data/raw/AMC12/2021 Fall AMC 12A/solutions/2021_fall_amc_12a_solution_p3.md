# 2021 Fall AMC 12A Problem 3

## Problem

Mr. Lopez has a choice of two routes to get to work. Route A is $6$ miles long, and his average speed along this route is $30$ miles per hour. Route B is $5$ miles long, and his average speed along this route is $40$ miles per hour, except for a $\frac{1}{2}$ -mile stretch in a school zone where his average speed is $20$ miles per hour. By how many minutes is Route B quicker than Route A?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2 \frac{3}{4} \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 3 \frac{3}{4} \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4 \frac{1}{2} \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 5 \frac{1}{2} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 6 \frac{3}{4}$

## Solution 1
If Mr. Lopez chooses Route A, then he will spend $\frac{6}{30}=\frac{1}{5}$ hour, or $\frac{1}{5}\cdot60=12$ minutes.
If Mr. Lopez chooses Route B, then he will spend $\frac{9/2}{40}+\frac{1/2}{20}=\frac{11}{80}$ hour, or $\frac{11}{80}\cdot60=8\frac14$ minutes.
Therefore, Route B is quicker than Route A by $12-8\frac14=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 3 \frac{3}{4}}$ minutes.

## Solution 2
We use the equation $d=st$ to solve this problem. Recall that $1$ mile per hour is equal to $\frac{1}{60}$ mile per minute.
For Route A, the distance is $6$ miles and the speed to travel this distance is $\frac{1}{2}$ mile per minute. Thus, the time it takes on Route A is $12$ minutes.
For Route B, we have to use the equation twice: once for the distance of $5- \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{2}$ miles with a speed of $\frac{2}{3}$ mile per minute and a distance of $\frac{1}{2}$ miles at a speed of $\frac{1}{3}$ mile per minute. Thus, the time it takes to go on Route B is $\frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 = \frac{27}{4} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{33}{4}$ minutes. Thus, Route B is $12 - \frac{33}{4} = \frac{15}{4} = 3\frac{3}{4}$ faster than Route A. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 3 \frac{3}{4}}.$
