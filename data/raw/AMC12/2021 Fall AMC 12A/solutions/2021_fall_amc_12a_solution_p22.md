## Problem

Azar and Carl play a game of tic-tac-toe. Azar places an $X$ one of the boxes in a $3$ -by- $3$ array of boxes, then Carl places an $O$ in one of the remaining boxes. After that, Azar places an $X$ in one of the remaining boxes, and so on until all 9 boxes are filled or one of the players has 3 of their symbols in a row—horizontal, vertical, or diagonal—whichever comes first, in which case that player wins the game. Suppose the players make their moves at random, rather than trying to follow a rational strategy, and that Carl wins the game when he places his third $O$ . How many ways can the board look after the game is over?

$\textbf{(A) } 36 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 112 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 120 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 148 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 160$

## Solution 1
We need to find out the number of configurations with 3 $O$ and 3 $X$ with 3 $O$ in a row, and 3 $X$ not in a row.
$\textbf{Case 1}$ : 3 $O$ are in a horizontal row or a vertical row.
Step 1: We determine the row that 3 $O$ occupy.
The number of ways is 6.
Step 2: We determine the configuration of 3 $X$ .
The number of ways is $\binom{6}{3} - 2 = 18$ . (6 open spots to put the $X$ and subtracting cases where they fill row/column)
In this case, following from the rule of product, the number of ways is $6 \cdot 18 = 108$ .
$\textbf{Case 2}$ : 3 $O$ are in a diagonal row.
Step 1: We determine the row that 3 $O$ occupy.
The number of ways is 2.
Step 2: We determine the configuration of 3 $X$ .
The number of ways is $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ .
In this case, following from the rule of product, the number of ways is $2 \cdot 20 = 40$ .
Putting all cases together, the total number of ways is $108 + 40 = 148$ .
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }148}$ .

## Solution 2 (Complementary)
First count all the ways to have 3 $O$ in a row and 3 $X$ . The $O$ can be arranged in 8 possible ways ( $3$ horizontal, $3$ vertical, $2$ diagonal), and in each case, the $X$ can be arranged in $\binom{6}{3}$ ways, so there are $8* \binom{6}{3}$ = 160 arrangements.
Now exclude the ones in which the $X$ are also in a row column. Either the $X$ and $O$ both form rows, which can be achieved in 6 ways, or they both form columns, which can also be acheived in 6 ways. Excluding these 12 arrangements, the answer is shown to be $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }148}$ .
