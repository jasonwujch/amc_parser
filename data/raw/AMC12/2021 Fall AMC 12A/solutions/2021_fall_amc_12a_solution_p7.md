# 2021 Fall AMC 12A Problem 7

## Problem

A school has $100$ students and $5$ teachers. In the first period, each student is taking one class, and each teacher is teaching one class. The enrollments in the classes are $50, 20, 20, 5,$ and $5$ . Let $t$ be the average value obtained if a teacher is picked at random and the number of students in their class is noted. Let $s$ be the average value obtained if a student was picked at random and the number of students in their class, including the student, is noted. What is $t-s$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ {-}18.5 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ {-}13.5 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 0 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 13.5 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 18.5$

## Solution
The formula for expected values is \[\text{Expected Value}=\sum(\text{Outcome}\cdot\text{Probability}).\] We have \begin{align*} t &= 50\cdot\frac15 + 20\cdot\frac15 + 20\cdot\frac15 + 5\cdot\frac15 + 5\cdot\frac15 \\ &= (50+20+20+5+5)\cdot\frac15 \\ &= 100\cdot\frac15 \\ &= 20, \\ s &= 50\cdot\frac{50}{100} + 20\cdot\frac{20}{100} + 20\cdot\frac{20}{100} + 5\cdot\frac{5}{100} + 5\cdot\frac{5}{100} \\ &= 25 + 4 + 4 + 0.25 + 0.25 \\ &= 33.5. \end{align*} Therefore, the answer is $t-s=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ {-}13.5}.$
