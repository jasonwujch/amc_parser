## Problem

A triangle has area $30$ , one side of length $10$ , and the median to that side of length $9$ . Let $\theta$ be the acute angle formed by that side and the median. What is $\sin{\theta}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{3}{10}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{3}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{9}{20}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{2}{3}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{9}{10}$

## Solution 1
$AB$ is the side of length $10$ , and $CD$ is the median of length $9$ . The altitude of $C$ to $AB$ is $6$ because the 0.5(altitude)(base)=Area of the triangle. $\theta$ is $\angle CDE$ . To find $\sin{\theta}$ , just use opposite over hypotenuse with the right triangle $\triangle DCE$ . This is equal to $\frac69=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac23}$ .

## Solution 2
It is a well known fact that a median divides the area of a triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of $\triangle BCD = 15$ in the above figure. Expressing the area in terms of $\sin{\theta}$ , $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 9 \cdot \sin{\theta} = 15$ . Solving for $\sin{\theta}$ gives $\sin{\theta} = \frac{2}{3}$ . $\boxed{D}$ .

## Solution 3
The area of a triangle with sides $a, b$ and angle between them $\theta$ is $\frac{1}{2} ab \sin{\theta}.$ Therefore, $30 = \frac{1}{2} (9 \cdot 5) \sin{\theta} + \frac{1}{2} (9 \cdot 5) \sin{(180^{\circ} - \theta)},$ as two angles along the same line must be supplementary. This simplifies to $\sin{\theta} + \sin{(180^{\circ} - \theta)} = \frac{4}{3} = \sin{\theta} + \sin{180^{\circ}}\cos{\theta} - \cos{180^{\circ}}\sin{\theta}.$
$2 \sin{\theta} = \frac{4}{3} \to \sin{\theta} = \frac{2}{3}.$ $\boxed{D}$
