## Problem

A bug crawls along a number line, starting at $-2$ . It crawls to $-6$ , then turns around and crawls to $5$ . How many units does the bug crawl altogether?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 9\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 11\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 13\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 14\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 15$

## Solution
[asy] draw((-2,1)--(-6,1),red+dashed,EndArrow); draw((-6,2)--(5,2),blue+dashed,EndArrow); dot((-2,0)); dot((-6,0)); dot((5,0)); label("$-2$",(-2,0),dir(270)); label("$-6$",(-6,0),dir(270)); label("$5$",(5,0),dir(270)); label("$4$",(-4,0.9),dir(270)); label("$11$",(-1.5,2.5),dir(90)); [/asy]
Crawling from $-2$ to $-6$ takes it a distance of $4$ units. Crawling from $-6$ to $5$ takes it a distance of $11$ units. Add $4$ and $11$ to get $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 15}$
