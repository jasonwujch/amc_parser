# 2012 AMC 12A Problem 6

## Problem

The sums of three whole numbers taken in pairs are 12, 17, and 19. What is the middle number?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 7\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 8$

## Solution 1
Let the three numbers be equal to $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . We can now write three equations:
$a+b=12$
$b+c=17$
$a+c=19$
Adding these equations together, we get that
$2(a+b+c)=48$ and
$a+b+c=24$
Substituting the original equations into this one, we find
$c+12=24$
$a+17=24$
$b+19=24$
Therefore, our numbers are 12, 7, and 5. The middle number is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7}$

## Solution 2 (Faster)
Let the three numbers be $a$ , $b$ and $c$ and $a<b<c$ . We get the three equations:
$a+b=12$
$a+c=17$
$b+c=19$
To isolate $b$ , We add the first and last equations and then subtract the second one.
$(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c) = 12+19-17 \Rightarrow 2b=14 \Rightarrow b = 7$
Because $b$ is the middle number, the middle number is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7}$
