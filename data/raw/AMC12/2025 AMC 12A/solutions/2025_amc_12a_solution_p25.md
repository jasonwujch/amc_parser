# 2025 AMC 12A Problem 25

## Problem

Polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ each have degree $3$ and leading coefficient $1$ , and their roots are all elements of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ . The function $f(x) = \tfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ has the property that there exist real numbers $a < b < c < d$ such that the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $f(x) \leq 0$ consists of the closed interval $[a,b]$ together with the open interval $(c,d)$ . How many ordered pairs of polynomials $(P, Q)$ are possible?

$\textbf{(A)}~7 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~9 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~11 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~12 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~13 \qquad \textbf{(F)}~8$

### Why MAA initially got this wrong

If you look at solution 2, they overcounted the second case, essentially saying that $f$ had $2$ choices because it could equal $c$ or $d$ , so the intended answer was $3 + 5 \cdot 2 = 13.$ This would be correct if the problem was asking for the number of pairs of polynomials. But there is actually only $1$ choice for $f$ because no matter what variable we choose $f$ to equal, both polynomial combinations result in the same function. So the correct answer was $3 + 5 \cdot 1 = 8$ functions.

## Solution 1 (Got Wrong)
None of the answer choices on the official test (which asked for the number of possible functions $f(x)$ ) were correct, but choice E would be correct if this problem asked for the number of pairs of functions $(P(x), Q(x))$ .
Let $R(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ . Since $R(x) \leq 0$ on $[a, b]$ but not for values slightly less than $a$ or slightly more than $b$ , $P(x) = 0$ at $x = a$ and $x = b$ . Therefore, $P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-r)$ for some $r \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ .
Since $R(x) \leq 0$ on $(c, d)$ but not at $x = c$ or $x = d$ , $R(x)$ is not continuous at $x = c$ or $x = d$ . Therefore, $R(x)$ must be undefined at $x = c$ and $x = d$ , that is, $Q(x) = 0$ at $x = c$ and $x = d$ . So $Q(x) = (x-c)(x-d)(x-s)$ for some $s \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ .
Therefore, $R(x) = \frac{(x-a)(x-b)(x-r)}{(x-c)(x-d)(x-s)}$ . Notice that $\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)} \leq 0$ only on $[a, b]$ and $(c, d)$ . Therefore, $\frac{x-r}{x-s}$ must be nonnegative for all $x \notin \{a, b, c, d, r, s\}$ . This only happens if $r = s$ .
Thus $R(x) = \frac{(x-a)(x-b)(x-r)}{(x-c)(x-d)(x-r)}$ , which is the same as $\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)}$ except that it is undefined at $x = r$ . Thus $R(x)$ satisfies the desired property as long as $r \notin [a, b] \cup (c, d)$ .
Note that each quintuple $(a, b, c, d, r)$ defines a unique pair of functions $(P(x), Q(x))$ .
If $(a, b, c, d) = (1, 2, 3, 4)$ , $r$ can be $3$ , $4$ , or $5$ .
If $(a, b, c, d) = (1, 2, 3, 5)$ , $r$ can be $3$ or $5$ .
If $(a, b, c, d) = (1, 2, 4, 5)$ , $r$ can be $3$ , $4$ , or $5$ .
If $(a, b, c, d) = (1, 3, 4, 5)$ , $r$ can be $4$ or $5$ .
If $(a, b, c, d) = (2, 3, 4, 5)$ , $r$ can be $1$ , $4$ , or $5$ .
Therefore, there are $\boxed{(\textbf{E})\ 13}$ possible pairs of functions $(P(x), Q(x))$ .

## Solution 2 (credit to Sohil Rathi's video solution, pi_is_3.14 / OmegaLearn)
This is the solution to the original problem, which asked for the number of possible functions , not pairs of polynomials.
First, consider the problem if it were talking about two second degree polynomials. We can see that the function \[f(x) = \frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)}\] by itself satisfies the condition of dropping below the x axis over $[a,b] \cup (c,d).$ Now, we need to add one extra $(x-n)$ term each to the numerator and denominator.
Case 1: $f(x) = \frac{(x-a)(x-b)(x-f)}{(x-c)(x-d)(x-f)}$ for some other value $f$ not equal to $a, b, c,$ or $d.$
Note that $f$ cannot be between $a$ and $b$ or between $c$ and $d$ because this would create a hole in the interval. So the only possibilities are:
- $a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, f = 5$
- $a = 1, b = 2, c = 4, d = 5, f = 3$
- $a = 2, b = 3, c = 4, d = 5, f = 1$
This gives us $3$ valid functions so far.
Case 2: $f(x) = \frac{(x-a)(x-b)(x-f)}{(x-c)(x-d)(x-f)}$ where $f$ is $c$ or $d.$
If $f$ equals $c$ or $d$ the resulting function is essentially equivalent to $f(x) = \frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)}$ because a hole would already exist, so we can safely cancel the $(x-f)$ terms. It doesn't matter whether we choose $f$ to equal $c$ or $d$ because the function will still be the same. There are $\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways to select the values for $a, b, c,$ and $d$ and $1$ way to choose any variable for $f$ to equal, giving $5 \cdot 1 = 5$ valid functions for this case.
The correct answer is $5 + 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(F) } 8}$ functions.

i tried my best to show what I think was Sohil's thought process, but please feel free to edit this if you can explain it better :)

## Solution 3
Solution 1 by user j314andrews is incomplete; Solution 2 by user grogg007 commits a serious logical error because it only provides functions that satisfy the requirements, without showing that no other functions do. Other places like [1] gives a good solution, but unfortunately it requires calculus. Here I am trying to provide a good solution that does not require calculus.
Let $D$ and $E$ be the set of the real roots of $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ , respectively. Then, outside of the intervals $[a,b]$ and $(c,d)$ , $f(x)>0$ except when $x \in E$ , where $f(x)$ is undefined.
For any function $g(x)$ , define a real number $t$ as a toggling point for $g(x)$ if there exists a sequence $t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_N$ , with the understanding that $t_0 = -\infty$ and $t_{N+1} = \infty$ , such that
- $t = t_k$ for some $1 \leq k \leq N$ ,
- $g(x)$ is of the same sign (either always positive or always negative) on each interval $(t_j, t_{j+1})$ , for $j=0, ..., N$ , and
- $g(x)$ has opposite signs on $(t_{k-1}, t_k)$ and $(t_k, t_{k+1})$ .
We call these open intervals $(t_j, t_{j+1})$ ( $j=0, ..., N$ ) the bands of $g(x)$ .
The polynomial $P(x)$ has no toggling point outside of $D$ , and $Q(x)$ has no toggling point outside of $E$ . Now in our problem, $f(x)$ has exactly 4 toggling points: $a, b, c, d$ . Our task is to see how these four points are related to the sets $D$ and $E$ .
Lemma . At each toggling point $t$ for $f(x)$ ,
1. either $P(t)=0$ or $Q(t)=0$ (or both);
1. if the multiplicities of the root $t$ of $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are $m$ and $n$ , respectively, then $m-n$ is odd.
Proof . (1) if both $P(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are nonzero, then $t$ belongs to a band of $P(x)$ and a band of $Q(x)$ . Taking the intersection between these two bands, we get an open interval on which $f(x)$ has the same sign as $f(t)$ . Thus $t$ cannot be a toggling point of $f(x)$ .
(2) If $m$ is odd, there are real numbers $r, s$ , with $r<t<s$ , such that $P(x)$ has the same sign on $(r,t)$ and has the opposite sign on $(t, s)$ . If $m$ is even, there are real numbers $r, s$ , with $r<t<s$ , such that $P(x)$ has the same sign on $(r,t)$ and on $(t,s)$ . Similar statements can be made of $Q(x)$ , having intervals $(u, t)$ and $(t, v)$ so that $Q(t)$ is of the same sign on $(u,t)$ , and of either a different or the same sign on $(t, v)$ , depending on the parity of $n$ . If both $m$ and $n$ are odd or both $m$ and $n$ are even, then $P(t)/Q(t)$ is of the same sign on the interval $(\max\{r, u\}, t)$ and $(t, \min\{s, v\})$ , so $t$ cannot be a toggling point for $f(x)$ .
Solution to the problem . Since $a$ is a toggling point for $f(x)$ , either $P(a)=0$ or $Q(a)=0$ , or both. But since $f(a)$ is defined, we have $Q(a)\neq 0$ , so $P(a)=0$ . The same can be said of $b$ , so $P(b)=0$ . The multiplicities of $a$ and $b$ must be $1$ . Otherwise, point (2) of the Lemma would require the multiplicity of one of them to be at least $3$ , but $P(x)$ is only cubic.
$c$ is a toggling point for $f(x)$ , so either $P(c)=0$ or $Q(c)=0$ , or both. But if $Q(c)\neq 0$ , we have $f(c)=0$ , violating the condition. So $Q(c)=0$ . Similarly, $Q(d)=0$ . Concerning their multiplicities, point (2) of the Lemma gives us three cases, given that $Q(x)$ is only cubic:
- (a) $c$ is a single root of $Q(x)$ , $P(c)\neq 0$ , $d$ is a double root of $Q(x)$ and a single root of $P(x)$ ;
- (b) switching the roles of $c$ and $d$ ;
- (c) both $c$ and $d$ are single roots of $Q(x)$ , and $Q(x)$ has a single root $e$ other than $c$ and $d$ .
Case (a) provides functions in the form of $\frac{(x-a)(x-b)(x-d)}{(x-c)(x-d)^2}$ . There are 5 of them because there are 5 ways to choose $a, b, c, d$ from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ .
Case (b) provides functions in the form of $\frac{(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)}{(x-c)^2(x-d)}$ , but they are the same as those provided in case (a). To ensure this, notice that the two expressions have the same domain and they are equal for every $x$ in their domains.
Case (c) requires that $P(e)=0$ , because if $P(e)\neq 0$ then $e$ becomes an extra toggling point for $f(x)$ . So this case provides functions in the form of $\frac{(x-a)(x-b)(x-e)}{(x-c)(x-d)(x-e)}$ . But since $f(e)$ is undefined, we need to make sure that $e$ does not fall into $[a,b]$ or $(c,d)$ . So $e$ can be $1, 3, 5$ . In all these cases, we also have $f(e) = \frac{(e-a)(e-b)}{(e-c)(e-d)} > 0$ , satisfying the conditions. That's 3 more functions.
So the total number of functions is $5 + 3 = \boxed{8}$ .

## Solution 4 (Multiplicity Analysis)
For the condition $f(x)\le 0 \iff x\in [a,b]\cup(c,d)$ , $f$ must change sign at $a, b, c,$ and $d$ . The key trick is that a rational function can only change sign through zeroes or discontinuities. Since both $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are monic cubic polynomials, $f(x) \to 1$ as $x \to \pm\infty$ . This means $f(x)$ is $+$ for large $|x|$ . The required sign pattern must therefore be: \[f(x): \quad +\underset{ a }{ [ }-\underset{ b }{ ] }+\underset{ c }{ ( }-\underset{ d }{ ) }+\]
- For the interval to be closed, $[a, b]$ , we must have $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 0$ . This implies $P(a) = P(b) = 0$ and, critically, $Q(a) \neq 0$ and $Q(b) \neq 0$ to avoid discontinuity.
- For the interval to be open, $(c, d)$ , the function must be undefined at the endpoints: if $f(c)$ were defined, by the intermediate value theorem $f(c)=0$ , violating the condition. This implies $Q(c) = 0$ and $Q(d) = 0$ . Note that $P(c),P(d)$ could be $0$ , as $\frac{0}{0}$ remains undefined.
From this, we conclude that $a, b, c, d\in \{ 1,2,3,4,5 \}$ . Let the remaining root in be $t$ , so $\{ 1,2,3,4,5 \}=\{ a,b,c,d,t \}$ .
Let $p_i, q_i\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ be the multiplicities of a root $i=1,2,3,4,5$ in $P(x),Q(x)$ , respectively, e.g. $P(x)=(x-1)^{p_{1}}(x-2)^{p_{2}}(x-3)^{p_{3}}(x-4)^{p_{4}}(x-5)^{p_{5}}$ . Let the multiplicity in $f(x)$ at $i$ be $m_i = p_i - q_i$ . A sign change occurs at $i$ if and only if $m_i$ is odd.
- The sign changes at $a, b, c, d$ . Thus, $m_a, m_b, m_c, m_d$ must all be odd.
- The sign does not change at $t$ . Thus, $m_t$ must be even.
From the root analysis, $q_a = 0 \implies m_a=p_{a}-q_{a} = p_a$ is odd. Similarly, $p_b$ is odd. Since $\deg(P) = \sum p_i = 3$ , and $p_a, p_b\ge 1$ are odd, $m_{a}=m_{b}=p_{a}=p_{b}=1$ . This forces the roots of $P(x)$ to be distinct: $\{a, b, k\}$ for some $k \in \{ 1,2,3,4,5 \} \setminus \{a, b\}$ with $p_{k}=1$ .
We already distributed $2$ roots for $P$ and $Q$ each, so there is $1$ left to give. Our constraints give $p_{c}+p_{d}+p_{t}=1$ , $p_{c},p_{d},p_{t}\in \{ 0,1 \}$ and $q_{t}\in \{0,1\}$ , $q_{c}, q_{d}\in \{ 1,2 \}$ . We can make some inferences:
- $p_{c}\in \{ 0,1 \}$ , $q_c \in \{ 1,2 \}$ , $m_c=p_{c}-q_{c} \in \{ -2,-1,0 \}$ . Since $m_c$ is odd, $m_{c} = -1$ . Similarly, $m_{d}=-1$ .
- $p_{t}\in \{ 0,1 \}$ , $q_{t}\in \{ 0,1 \}$ , $m_{t}=p_{t}-q_{t}\in \{ -1,0,1 \}$ . Since $m_{t}$ is even, $m_{t}=0$ .
At this point, we have $(m_{a},m_{b},m_{c},m_{d},m_{t})=(1,1,-1,-1,0)$ . But this is exactly the distribution of multiplicities of $\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)}$ , which is forced from the beginning. Thus, the remaining multiplicity of each of $P$ and $Q$ must cancel into a single bin to create net multiplicity $0=1-1$ , yielding
\[f(x)=\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)}\cdot \frac{x-k}{x-k}\] where $k=c,d,t$ , and this creates a hole if there isn't one already. However, the problem is that if there is already a hole (i.e. $k=c,d$ ), then this factor $\frac{x-k}{x-k}$ changes nothing as $f$ was already undefined at $x=k$ , so while it gives a different pair of polynomials, it does not provide a new function $f$ .
Cases $k=c,d$ are symmetric:
WLOG, let $k=c$ , and choosing $t=1,2,3,4,5$ determines the remaining $1\le a<b<c<d \le 5$ . Each $t$ creates a unique pair of polynomials, so there are $2\cdot \binom{5}{1}=10$ pairs of polynomials. However, as established, puncturing a hole again on $k=c,d$ does nothing: \[f(x)=\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)}\cdot \frac{x-c}{x-c}=\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(x-c)(x-d)}\cdot \frac{x-d}{x-d}\] So each $t$ creates exactly one new function regardless of whether $k=c$ or $k=d$ , i.e. there are only $5$ new functions.
Case $k=t$ :
Sketching a quick diagram for $(\text{sign pattern of }f)$ , $t$ cannot puncture $[a,b]$ nor $(c,d)$ , meaning it must lie outside them. All other cases cases do work, since you can puncture $+$ intervals without affecting $-$ intervals. \[\begin{cases} t,[a,b],(c,d) \\ [a,b],t,(c,d) \\ [a,b],(c,d),t \end{cases}\] Hence, there are $3$ valid choices of $t$ .
In total, there are $10+3=\boxed{ \textbf{(E)}~13 }$ ordered pairs of polynomials $(P,Q)$ but only $\boxed{ 8 }$ different functions created by $f=\frac{P}{Q}$ .
