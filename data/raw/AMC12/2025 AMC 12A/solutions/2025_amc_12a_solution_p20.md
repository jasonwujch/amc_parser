## Problem

The base of the pentahedron shown below is a $13 \times 8$ rectangle, and its lateral faces are two isosceles triangles with base of length $8$ and congruent sides of length $13$ , and two isosceles trapezoids with bases of length $7$ and $13$ and nonparallel sides of length $13$ .

[asy] /* Refined by Mathemagician108 */ import graph3; size(200); real l = 13; real w = 8; real offset = (l - 7)/2; // 3 real midy = w/2; // 4 real h = 12; triple O1 = (0,0,0); triple O2 = (l,0,0); triple O3 = (l,w,0); triple O4 = (0,w,0); triple T1 = (offset, midy, h); triple T2 = (l - offset, midy, h); currentprojection=orthographic((-4,-6,3)); draw(O4--O1--O2, linewidth(1)); draw(O2--O3--O4, dashed + linewidth(1)); draw(O3--T2, dashed + linewidth(1)); draw(O1--T1, linewidth(1)); draw(O4--T1, linewidth(1)); draw(O2--T2, linewidth(1)); draw(T1--T2, linewidth(1)); label("13", (O1+O2)/2, 3*-Y); // Bottom length label("13", (O2+T2)/2, 1.5*X); label("13", (O4+T1)/2, 2*-X); label("8", (O1+O4)/2, 2*-X); // Width label("7", (T1+T2)/2, 1.5*Z); // Top length [/asy]

What is the volume of the pentahedron?

$\textbf{(A) } 416 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 520 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 528 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 676 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 832$

## Solution 1 (Split Into Three Parts)
Notice that the triangular faces have a slant height of $\sqrt{13^2-4^2}=\sqrt{153}$ and that the height is therefore $\sqrt{153-(\frac{13-7}{2})^2} = 12$ . Then we can split the pentahedron into a triangular prism and two pyramids. The pyramids each have a volume of $\frac{1}{3}(3)(8)(12) = 96$ and the prism has a volume of $\frac{1}{2}(8)(12)(7) = 336$ . Thus the answer is $336+96 \cdot 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 528}$

## Solution 2
Note that the height is $12$ from the previous method. Note that as you go up, the length and width both decrease linearly and reach $0$ at the end.
So the answer is $\int_0^{12} (8 - \tfrac{2}{3}x)(13 - \tfrac{1}{2}x) dx = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 528}$

## Solution (3D Pythagoras)
Let $H$ be the height of the solid. By 3D Pythagoras (recursion of 2D Pythagoras), \[\left( \frac{8}{2} \right)^2+\left( \frac{13-7}{2} \right)^2+H^2=13^2=4^2+3^2+H^2=5^2+H^2\] This gives the $5-12-13$ triple, so $H=12$ . Continue as in other solutions.
