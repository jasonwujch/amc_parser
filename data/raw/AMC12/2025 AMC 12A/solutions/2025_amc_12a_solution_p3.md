# 2025 AMC 12A Problem 3

## Problem

A team of students is going to compete against a team of teachers in a trivia contest. The total number of students and teachers is $15$ . Ash, a cousin of one of the students, wants to join the contest. If Ash plays with the students, the average age on that team will increase from $12$ to $14$ . If Ash plays with the teachers, the average age on that team will decrease from $55$ to $52$ . How old is Ash?

$\textbf{(A)}~28\qquad\textbf{(B)}~29\qquad\textbf{(C)}~30\qquad\textbf{(D)}~32\qquad\textbf{(E)}~33$

## Solution 1
When Ash joins a team, the team's average is pulled towards his age. Let $A$ be Ash's age and $N$ be the number of people on the student team. This means that there are $15-N$ people in the teacher team. Let us write an expression for the change in the average for each team.
The students originally had an average of $12$ , which became $14$ when Ash joined, so there was an increase of $2$ . The term $A-12$ represents how much older Ash is compared to the average of the students'. If we divide this by $N+1$ , which is the number of people on the student team when Ash joins, we get the average change per team member once Ash is added. Therefore, \[\frac{A-12}{N+1} = 2.\]
Similarly, for teachers, the average was originally $55$ , which decreased by $3$ to become $52$ when Ash joined. Intuitively, $55-A$ represents how much younger Ash is than the average age of the teachers. Dividing this by the expression $(15-N)+1$ , which is the new total number of people on the teacher team, represents the average change per team member once Ash joins. We can write the equation
\[\frac{55-A}{16-N} = 3.\]
To solve the system, multiply equation (1) by $N+1$ , and similarly multiply equation (2) by $16-N$ . Then add the equations together, canceling $A$ , leaving equation $43=50-N$ . From this we get $N=7$ and $A= \boxed{28}.$

## Solution 2
As shown above, we get the equation \[\frac{55-A}{16-N} = 3.\] Rearranging we get \[\frac{55-A}{3} = 16-N.\] Therefore, since N must be an integer, $55-A$ must be divisible by 3. Plugging in values gets us $A= \boxed{28}.$

## Solution 3
Another way is to say that there are S students and T teachers and Ash's age is A. We can create the equation \[(1) S+T=15\] . We can also create the equations \[(2) \frac{12S+A}{S+1}=14\] and \[(3) \frac{55T+A}{T+1}=52\] Equation (2) simplifies to $A=2S+14$ and equation (3) simplifies to $A=-3T+52$ . Multiply (2) by $3$ to get equation \[(4) 3A=6S+42\] and (3) by $-2$ to get \[(5) -2A=6T-104\] Add (4) and (5) to get $A=6(S+T)-62$ . After substituting equation (1) and simplifying, you get $A=\boxed{28}$ or answer choice $\boxed{A}$ .
