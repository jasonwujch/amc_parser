# 2025 AMC 12A Problem 15

## Problem

A set of numbers is called sum-free if whenever $x$ and $y$ are (not necessarily distinct) elements of the set, $x+y$ is not an element of the set. For example, $\{1,4,6\}$ and the empty set are sum-free, but $\{1,4,5\}$ is not. What is the greatest possible number of elements in a sum-free subset of $\{1,2,3,...,20\}$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 8 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 9 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 10 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 11 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 12$

## Solution 1
Let our subset be $\{11,12,13,...,20\}.$ If we add any element from the set $\{1,2,3,...,10\}$ to our current subset, we will have to remove at least one element from our subset. Hence, the maximum size of our subset is $\boxed{\text{(C) }10}$ .

## Solution 2(Quicksolve)
Notice that an odd number plus an odd number always results in an even number. Consider the subset of all odd numbers $S = \{1, 3, 5, ..., 19\}$ . The addition of any even number will result in a violation of the rules, so the maximum number of elements in this subset is $\boxed{\text{(C) }10}$ .

## Solution 3
Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, ..., 20\}$ . We are looking for the largest possible sum-free subset $A \subseteq S$ .
First, we show that a sum-free set of size 10 is possible. Consider the set $A_1 = \{11, 12, ..., 20\}$ . The smallest possible sum of two elements (not necessarily distinct) from this set is $11 + 11 = 22$ . Since $22 > 20$ , no sum of two elements from $A_1$ can be in $A_1$ . The size of $A_1$ is $20 - 11 + 1 = 10$ . Thus, a sum-free set of size 10 exists.
Next, we prove that no sum-free set $A \subseteq S$ can have 11 or more elements. Let $m$ be the largest element in $A$ . Since $A$ is sum-free and $m \in A$ , for any $x \in A$ , we must have $m-x \notin A$ (unless $x = m-x$ , in which case $x \notin A$ ). This is because if both $x$ and $m-x$ were in $A$ , their sum $x + (m-x) = m$ would be in $A$ , which is a contradiction.
We can partition the set $\{1, 2, ..., m\}$ into pairs that sum to $m$ , plus any leftover elements.
Case 1: $m$ is even. Let $m = 2k$ . The numbers in $\{1, ..., m\}$ can be grouped as: $\{ (1, 2k-1), (2, 2k-2), ..., (k-1, k+1) \}$ along with the numbers $k$ and $m=2k$ .
- $A$ contains $m$ .
- $A$ cannot contain $k$ , because $k+k = 2k = m$ , which is in $A$ .
- $A$ can contain at most one number from each of the $k-1$ pairs.
The maximum number of elements $A$ can contain from $\{1, ..., m\}$ is $1 + 0 + (k-1) = k = m/2$ . Since $m \le 20$ , the maximum size of $A$ is $m/2 \le 20/2 = 10$ .
Case 2: $m$ is odd. Let $m = 2k-1$ . The numbers in $\{1, ..., m\}$ can be grouped as: $\{ (1, 2k-2), (2, 2k-3), ..., (k-1, k) \}$ along with $m=2k-1$ .
- $A$ contains $m$ .
- $A$ can contain at most one number from each of the $k-1$ pairs.
The maximum number of elements $A$ can contain from $\{1, ..., m\}$ is $1 + (k-1) = k$ . Since $m = 2k-1$ , we have $k = (m+1)/2$ . The largest possible odd $m$ is 19. If $m=19$ , $k = (19+1)/2 = 10$ . So the maximum size of $A$ is $(m+1)/2 \le (19+1)/2 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 10}$ .
In all cases, a sum-free subset of $S$ can have at most 10 elements. Since we found a set with 10 elements, the greatest possible number of elements is $10$ .

## Solution 4 (Another quicksolve)
Note that selecting integers from $\{11, 12, ..., 20\}$ also satisfy the constraints of the problem. The minimum sum of any two members of the set is $11 + 11 = 22$ which is greater than any of the elements.

## Solution 5 (with quick proof)
As all of the above solutions point out, the set $\{11, ..., 20\}$ satisfies the required condition, and so the greatest size of a sum-free set is no less than 10. How do we know that 11 isn't possible? Induction is our friend here.
We want to prove that the set $\{1, ..., 2n\}$ has a sum-free set of size no more than $n$ . It is obvious for $n=1$ . Suppose it is true for $n-1$ . Now let $S$ be a sum-free subset of $\{1, ..., 2n\}$ and that it has at least $n+1$ elements. The intersection of $S$ and $\{1, ..., 2n-2\}$ is sum-free, so it has no more than $n-1$ elements. So we must include both $2n-1$ and $2n$ into $S$ . If so, then $1$ and $n$ cannot belong to $S$ .
We are now searching for $n-1$ more elements. But we can make $n-2$ 'pigeonholes': $\{2, 2n-2\}, \{3, 2n-3\}, ..., \{n-1, n+1\}$ , seeing that they can provide no more than $n-2$ elements because each pigeonhole will have a sum of $2n$ .
