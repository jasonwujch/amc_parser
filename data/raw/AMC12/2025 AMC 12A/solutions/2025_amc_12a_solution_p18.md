## Problem

How many ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ of different positive integers less than or equal to $8$ satisfy $xy > z$ , $xz > y$ , and $yz > x$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}~36 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~84 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~186 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~336 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~486$

## Solution 1
Let $0<x<y<z \le 8$ ; $x$ cannot be $1$ because it makes $xy>z$ $\rightarrow$ $y>z$ ;
$x=2$ , $y=3$ , $z$ can be $4$ , $5$ but not others; $x=2$ , $y=4$ , $z$ can be $5$ , $6$ , $7$ ; $x=2$ , $y=5$ , $z$ can be $6$ , $7$ , $8$ ; $x=2$ , $y=6$ , $z$ can be $7$ , $8$ ; $x=2$ , $y=7$ , $z$ can be $8$ ; for $x=2$ , total $11$ cases;
Similarly, for $x=3$ , $y=4$ , $5$ , $6$ , $7$ , total $10$ cases; for $x=4$ , $y=5$ , $6$ , $7$ , total $6$ cases; $x=5$ , $y=6$ , $7$ , $3$ cases; $x=6$ , $y=7$ , $z=8$ , $1$ cases;
Total $= 11 + 10 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 31$ . Permutate $x$ , $y$ , $z$ for ordered triple, it is $31 \cdot 6=186$ , $\fbox{C}$ .

## Solution 2
For now, assume $x\leq y\leq z$ .
First note that no number can be 0, as it would imply $0y>z$ . Similarly, no number can be 1, as it would imply $1y>z$ . So we only need to consider numbers between 2 and 8, inclusive.
We may use complementary counting:
Consider when $xy\leq z$ . This implies $xy\leq 8$ . Some quick calculations gives us the products $2\cdot2,2\cdot3,2\cdot4$ . We may now calculate the number of times each happens (we are no longer assuming $x\leq y\leq z$ ):
- $2\cdot2$ : This case is invalid as it asks for distinct integers.
- $2\cdot3$ : $2,3,(n\geq6)$ . Then we have $6\cdot3=18$ cases.
- $2\cdot4$ : $2,4,(n\geq8)$ . Then we have $6\cdot1=6$ cases.
In total, there are $7\cdot6\cdot5=210$ total cases, so our final answer is $210 - (18 + 6) = \boxed{186}$ .

## Solution 3
Note that if $x,y,z \ge 3$ , all pairs work - hence, we have $\binom{6}{3} \cdot 6 = 120$ pairs. Now, note that if $x=1$ , we get $y>z$ and $z>y$ , contradiction. Therefore, assume $x=2$ (since we said $x < 3, x \neq 1$ ). Note that we need $2y>z>\frac{y}{2}$ . WLOG assume $y>z$ , we get there are $11$ pairs that work (we just need $2z>y$ ): $(y,z) = (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (6,4), (6,5), (5,3), (5,4), (4,3)$ . With $x=2$ , we can re-arrange these in $3!=6$ ways each, hence the answer is just $120 + 6 \cdot 11 = \boxed{186}$ .

## Solution 4 (Bounding)
Note that if $x,y,z>2,$ then this must hold, as if it didn't, we would need, WLOG, $x>3y,$ which would imply $x>8.$ Therefore, there are at least $6\times 5\times 4=120$ solutions. However, we must have $x,y,z\ge2,$ as if any variable is $0,$ this clearly doesn't work, and $x=1$ gives $y>z$ and $z>y,$ which is impossible. Therefore, there are at most $7\times6\times5=210$ solutions. The only choice that works from here is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~186}$ ~krithikrokcs

## Solution 5(Compl. Counting)
The total number of cases is $7*6*5=210$ . Note that no number can be 1, since that would result in cases like $z>y$ and $z<y$ which is impossible.
We can try complementary counting. Since in this problem x,y,z cases are symmetrical, we first consider cases where $xy<z$ . The cases are: $(x,y,z): (2,3,6) (2,3,7) (2,3,8) (2,4,8)$ . By symmetry, the cases that don't work amounts to $4*6=24$ cases. Therefore the total number of cases that work is $210-24=186$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~186}$ . ~backtosq-1

## Solution 6 (Symmetry + Complementary Counting)
Since $\{ x,y,z \} \subset \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \}$ , WLOG let $1\le x<y<z\le 8$ ( $\times 3! =6$ ). Note that the lower bounds make the conditions $y<xz\le 1z$ and $x<zy<z$ trivial. In addition, $x=1$ always fails, since it would force $z<xy=y$ , a contradiction. Thus, it remains exactly to check $2\le x<y<z\le 8<xy$ .
The only failure cases with $xy\le 8$ can occur when $(x,y)=(2,3),(2,4)$ , for which we have corresponding $z\in \{ 6,7,8 \},\{ 8 \}$ . The total number of cases is $\binom{7}{3}=35$ . Thus, the number of good cases is $35-4=31$ , and after multiplying by order we get $3!\cdot 31=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~186}$ .
