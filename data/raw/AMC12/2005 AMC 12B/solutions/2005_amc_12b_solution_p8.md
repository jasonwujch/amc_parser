## Problem

For how many values of $a$ is it true that the line $y = x + a$ passes through the vertex of the parabola $y = x^2 + a^2$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 0 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 1 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 2 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 10 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ \text{infinitely many}$

## Solution
We see that the vertex of the quadratic function $y = x^2 + a^2$ is $(0,\,a^2)$ . The y-intercept of the line $y = x + a$ is $(0,\,a)$ . We want to find the values (if any) such that $a=a^2$ . Solving for $a$ , the only values that satisfy this are $0$ and $1$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 2}$
