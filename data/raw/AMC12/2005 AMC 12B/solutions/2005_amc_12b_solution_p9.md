# 2005 AMC 12B Problem 9

## Problem

On a certain math exam, $10\%$ of the students got $70$ points, $25\%$ got $80$ points, $20\%$ got $85$ points, $15\%$ got $90$ points, and the rest got $95$ points. What is the difference between the mean and the median score on this exam?

$\textbf{(A) }\ 0 \qquad \textbf{(B) }\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(C) }\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(D) }\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(E) }\ 5$

## Solution
To begin, we see that the remaining $30\%$ of the students got $95$ points. Assume that there are $20$ students; we see that $2$ students got $70$ points, $5$ students got $80$ points, $4$ students got $85$ points, $3$ students got $90$ points, and $6$ students got $95$ points. The median is $85$ , since the $10^{\text{th}}$ and $11^{\text{th}}$ terms are both $85$ . The mean is $\dfrac{70\,(2)+80\,(5)+85\,(4)+90\,(3)+95\,(6)}{20}=\dfrac{1720}{20}=86$ . The difference between the mean and median, therefore, is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1}$ .

## Solution 2
The remaining $30\%$ of the students got $95$ points. The mean is equal to $10\%\cdot70 + 25\%\cdot80 + 20\%\cdot85 + 15\%\cdot90 + 30\%\cdot95 = 86$ . The score greater than or equal to $50\%$ of other scores is the median. Since $35\%$ scored $80$ or lower and the next $20\%$ scored $85$ , the median is $85$ . The difference between the mean and the median is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1}$ .
