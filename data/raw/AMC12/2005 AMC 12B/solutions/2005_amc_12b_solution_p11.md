# 2005 AMC 12B Problem 11

## Problem

An envelope contains eight bills: $2$ ones, $2$ fives, $2$ tens, and $2$ twenties. Two bills are drawn at random without replacement. What is the probability that their sum is $ $20$ or more?

$\textbf{(A) }\ {{{\frac{1}{4}}}} \qquad \textbf{(B) }\ {{{\frac{2}{5}}}} \qquad \textbf{(C) }\ {{{\frac{3}{7}}}} \qquad \textbf{(D) }\ {{{\frac{1}{2}}}} \qquad \textbf{(E) }\ {{{\frac{2}{3}}}}$

## Solution 1
The only way to get a total of \$ $20$ or more is if you pick a twenty and another bill, or if you pick both tens. There are a total of $\dbinom{8}{2}=\dfrac{8\times7}{2\times1}=28$ ways to choose $2$ bills out of $8$ . There are $12$ ways to choose a twenty and some other non-twenty bill. There is $1$ way to choose both twenties, and also $1$ way to choose both tens. Adding these up, we find that there are a total of $14$ ways to attain a sum of $20$ or greater, so there is a total probability of $\dfrac{14}{28}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{1}{2}}$ .

## Solution 2
Another way to do this problem is to use complementary counting , i.e. how many ways that the sum is less than $20$ . Now, you do not have to consider the $2$ twenties, so you have $6$ bills left. $\dbinom{6}{2} = \dfrac{6\times5}{2\times1} = 15$ ways. However, you counted the case when you have $2$ tens, so you need to subtract 1, and you get $14$ . Finding the ways to get $20$ or higher, you subtract $14$ from $28$ and get $14$ . So the answer is $\dfrac{14}{28} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }\dfrac{1}{2}}$

## Solution 3
There are two cases that work, namely getting at least $1$ twenty, or getting $2$ tens.
Case $1$ : $P(\text{Get at least one twenty}) = 1-P(\text{Do not get a single twenty})=1- \frac{\binom{6}{2}}{\binom{8}{2}}=\frac{28-15}{28}=\frac{13}{28}$
Case $2$ : $P(\text{Get two tens}) = \frac{1}{\binom{8}{2}} = \frac{1}{28}$
Summing up our cases, we have $\frac{13}{28}+\frac{1}{28}=\frac{14}{28}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \dfrac{1}{2}}$

## Solution 4
Note that if a twenty is drawn, anything else that is drawn will create a total greater than $20$ ; The probability of a twenty being drawn first is $\frac{1}{4}.$ The same could be said for drawing anything, and then drawing a twenty. However, we can only draw something that isn't a twenty first (since we've already accounted for the probability of drawing two twenties).
The probability of drawing a non-twenty first, then a twenty second is $\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{7}=\frac{3}{14}.$ Finally, we can draw two tens. The probability of this occuring is $\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{7}=\frac{1}{28}.$
Adding these three probabilities gives us $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{14}+\frac{1}{28}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \dfrac{1}{2}}$

## Solution 5 (Quick if no time)
We see that there are $2$ of each bill. We can simplify the question to only drawing $1$ bill out of $4$ , and trying to draw $\$ 10$ . (Originally you need to draw $\$ 20$ , but the bill is halved, so you need to draw only $\$ 10$ .) We see that we have $1$ of each bill $\$1$ , $\$5$ , $\$10$ , and $\$20$ . Thus, we can easily see the solution is $\boxed{(D) \frac{1}{2}}$ .
