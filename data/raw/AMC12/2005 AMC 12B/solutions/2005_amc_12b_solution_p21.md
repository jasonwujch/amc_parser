## Problem

A positive integer $n$ has $60$ divisors and $7n$ has $80$ divisors. What is the greatest integer $k$ such that $7^k$ divides $n$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ {{{0}}} \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ {{{1}}} \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ {{{2}}} \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ {{{3}}} \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ {{{4}}}$

## Solution
We may let $n = 7^k \cdot m$ , where $m$ is not divisible by 7. Using the fact that the number of divisors function $d(n)$ is multiplicative, we have $d(n) = d(7^k)d(m) = (k+1)d(m) = 60$ . Also, $d(7n) = d(7^{k+1})d(m) = (k+2)d(m) = 80$ . These numbers are in the ratio 3:4, so $\frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{3}{4} \implies k = 2 \Rightarrow \boxed{\mathrm{C}}$ .
