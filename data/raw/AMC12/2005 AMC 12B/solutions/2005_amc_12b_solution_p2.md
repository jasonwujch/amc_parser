## Problem

A positive number $x$ has the property that $x\%$ of $x$ is $4$ . What is $x$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(B) }\ 4 \qquad \textbf{(C) }\ 10 \qquad \textbf{(D) }\ 20 \qquad \textbf{(E) }\ 40$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Since $x\%$ means $0.01x$ , the statement " $x\% \text{ of } x \text{ is 4}$ " can be rewritten as " $0.01x \cdot x = 4$ ":
$0.01x \cdot x=4 \Rightarrow x^2 = 400 \Rightarrow x = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }20}.$

## Solution 2
Try the answer choices one by one. Upon examination, it is quite obvious that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }20}.$ Very fast.
