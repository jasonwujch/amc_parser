# 2005 AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

An $8$ -foot by $10$ -foot bathroom floor is tiled with square tiles of size $1$ foot by $1$ foot. Each tile has a pattern consisting of four white quarter circles of radius $1/2$ foot centered at each corner of the tile. The remaining portion of the tile is shaded. How many square feet of the floor are shaded?

[asy] unitsize(2cm); defaultpen(linewidth(.8pt)); fill(unitsquare,gray); filldraw(Arc((0,0),.5,0,90)--(0,0)--cycle,white,black); filldraw(Arc((1,0),.5,90,180)--(1,0)--cycle,white,black); filldraw(Arc((1,1),.5,180,270)--(1,1)--cycle,white,black); filldraw(Arc((0,1),.5,270,360)--(0,1)--cycle,white,black); [/asy]

$\textbf{(A) }\ 80-20\pi \qquad \textbf{(B) }\ 60-10\pi \qquad \textbf{(C) }\ 80-10\pi \qquad \textbf{(D) }\ 60+10\pi \qquad \textbf{(E) }\ 80+10\pi$

## Solution
There are $80$ tiles. Each tile has $[\mbox{square} - 4 \cdot (\mbox{quarter circle})]$ shaded. Thus:
\begin{align*} \mbox{shaded area} &= 80 \left( 1 - 4 \cdot \dfrac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2\right) \\ &= 80\left(1-\dfrac{1}{4}\pi\right) \\ &= \boxed{\textbf{(A) }80-20\pi}. \end{align*} 4 quarters of a circle is a circle so that may save you 0.5 seconds (very much lots) :)
