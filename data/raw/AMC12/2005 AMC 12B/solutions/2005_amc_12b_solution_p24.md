## Problem

All three vertices of an equilateral triangle are on the parabola $y = x^2$ , and one of its sides has a slope of $2$ . The $x$ -coordinates of the three vertices have a sum of $m/n$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is the value of $m + n$ ?

## Solution 1 (Complex numbers)
Let the three points be at $A = (x_1, x_1^2)$ , $B = (x_2, x_2^2)$ , and $C = (x_3, x_3^2)$ , such that the slope between the first two is $2$ , and $A$ is the point with the least $y$ -coordinate.
Then, we have $\textrm{Slope of }AC = \frac{x_1^2 - x_3^2}{x_1 - x_3} = x_1 + x_3$ . Similarly, the slope of $BC$ is $x_2 + x_3$ , and the slope of $AB$ is $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ . The desired sum is $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$ , which is equal to the sum of the slopes divided by $2$ .
To find the slope of $AC$ , we note that it comes at a $60^{\circ}$ angle with $AB$ . Thus, we can find the slope of $AC$ by multiplying the two complex numbers $1 + 2i$ and $1 + \sqrt{3}i$ . What this does is generate the complex number that is at a $60^{\circ}$ angle with the complex number $1 + 2i$ . Then, we can find the slope of the line between this new complex number and the origin: \[(1+2i)(1+\sqrt{3}i)\] \[= 1 - 2\sqrt{3} + 2i + \sqrt{3}i\] \[\textrm{Slope } = \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\sqrt{3}}\] \[= \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{3}}{1 + 2\sqrt{3}}\] \[= \frac{8 + 5\sqrt{3}}{-11}\] \[= \frac{-8 - 5\sqrt{3}}{11}.\] The slope $BC$ can also be solved similarly, noting that it makes a $120^{\circ}$ angle with $AB$ : \[(1+2i)(-1+\sqrt{3}i)\] \[= -1 - 2\sqrt{3} - 2i + \sqrt{3}i\] \[\textrm{Slope } = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 2}{-2\sqrt{3} - 1}\] \[= \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{1 + 2\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\sqrt{3}}\]
At this point, we start to notice a pattern: This expression is equal to $\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{3}}{1 + 2\sqrt{3}}$ , except the numerators of the first fractions are conjugates! Notice that this means that when we multiply out, the rational term will stay the same, but the coefficient of $\sqrt{3}$ will have its sign switched. This means that the two complex numbers are conjugates, so their irrational terms cancel out.
Our sum is simply $2 - 2\cdot\frac{8}{11} = \frac{6}{11}$ , and thus we can divide by $2$ to obtain $\frac{3}{11}$ , which gives the answer $\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 14}$ .

## Solution 2
Using the slope formula and differences of squares, we find:
$a+b$ = the slope of $AB$ ,
$b+c$ = the slope of $BC$ ,
$a+c$ = the slope of $AC$ .
So the value that we need to find is the sum of the slopes of the three sides of the triangle divided by $2$ . Without loss of generality, let $AB$ be the side that has the smallest angle with the positive $x$ -axis. Let $J$ be an arbitrary point with the coordinates $(1, 0)$ . Translate the triangle so $A$ is at the origin. Then $\tan(BOJ) = 2$ . Since the slope of a line is equal to the tangent of the angle formed by the line and the positive x- axis, the answer is $\dfrac{\tan(BOJ) + \tan(BOJ+60) + \tan(BOJ-60)}{2}$ .
Using $\tan(BOJ) = 2$ , and the tangent addition formula, this simplifies to $\dfrac{3}{11}$ , so the answer is $3 + 11 = \boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 14}$
