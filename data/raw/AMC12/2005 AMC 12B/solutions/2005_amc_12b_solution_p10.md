# 2005 AMC 12B Problem 10

## Problem

The first term of a sequence is $2005$ . Each succeeding term is the sum of the cubes of the digits of the previous term. What is the ${2005}^{\text{th}}$ term of the sequence?

$\mathrm{(A)} 29 \qquad \mathrm{(B)} 55 \qquad \mathrm{(C)} 85 \qquad \mathrm{(D)} 133 \qquad \mathrm{(E)} 250$

## Solution
Performing this operation several times yields the results of $133$ for the second term, $55$ for the third term, and $250$ for the fourth term. The sum of the cubes of the digits of $250$ equal $133$ , a complete cycle. The cycle is, excluding the first term, the $2^{\text{nd}}$ , $3^{\text{rd}}$ , and $4^{\text{th}}$ terms will equal $133$ , $55$ , and $250$ , following the fourth term. Any term number that is equivalent to $1\ (\text{mod}\ 3)$ will produce a result of $250$ . It just so happens that $2005\equiv 1\ (\text{mod}\ 3)$ , which leads us to the answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 250}$ .
