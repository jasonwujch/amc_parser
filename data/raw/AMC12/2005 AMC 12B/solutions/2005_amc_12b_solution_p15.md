## Problem

The sum of four two-digit numbers is $221$ . None of the eight digits is $0$ and no two of them are the same. Which of the following is not included among the eight digits?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 1 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 2 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 3 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 4 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 5$

## Solution 1
$221$ can be written as the sum of four two-digit numbers, let's say $\overline{ae}$ , $\overline{bf}$ , $\overline{cg}$ , and $\overline{dh}$ . Then $221= 10(a+b+c+d)+(e+f+g+h)$ . The last digit of $221$ is $1$ , and $10(a+b+c+d)$ won't affect the units digits, so $(e+f+g+h)$ must end with $1$ . The smallest value $(e+f+g+h)$ can have is $(1+2+3+4)=10$ , and the greatest value is $(6+7+8+9)=30$ . Therefore, $(e+f+g+h)$ must equal $11$ or $21$ .
Case 1: $(e+f+g+h)=11$
The only distinct positive integers that can add up to $11$ is $(1+2+3+5)$ . So, $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ must include four of the five numbers $(4,6,7,8,9)$ . We have $10(a+b+c+d)=221-11=210$ , or $a+b+c+d=21$ . We can add all of $4+6+7+8+9=34$ , and try subtracting one number to get to $21$ , but none of them work. Therefore, $(e+f+g+h)$ cannot add up to $11$ .
Case 2: $(e+f+g+h)=21$
Checking all the values for $e$ , $f$ , $g$ ,and $h$ each individually may be time-consuming, instead of only having $1$ solution like Case 1. We can try a different approach by looking at $(a+b+c+d)$ first. If $(e+f+g+h)=21$ , $10(a+b+c+d)=221-21=200$ , or $(a+b+c+d)=20$ . That means $(a+b+c+d)+(e+f+g+h)=21+20=41$ . We know $(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)=45$ , so the missing digit is $45-41=\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 4}$

## Solution 2
Alternatively, we know that a number is congruent to the sum of its digits mod 9, so $221 \equiv 5 \equiv 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 - d \equiv -d$ , where $d$ is some digit. Clearly, $\boxed{d = 4}$ .
