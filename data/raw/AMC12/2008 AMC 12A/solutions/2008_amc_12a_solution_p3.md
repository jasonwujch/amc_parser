## Problem

Suppose that $\tfrac{2}{3}$ of $10$ bananas are worth as much as $8$ oranges. How many oranges are worth as much as $\tfrac{1}{2}$ of $5$ bananas?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 2\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{5}{2}\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 3\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \frac{7}{2}\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 4$

## Solution
If $\frac{2}{3}\cdot10\ \text{bananas}=8\ \text{oranges}$ , then $\frac{1}{2}\cdot5\ \text{bananas}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\ \text{bananas}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{8\ \text{oranges}}{\frac{2}{3}\cdot10\ \text{bananas}}\right)=3\ \text{oranges}\Longrightarrow\mathrm{(C)}$ .
