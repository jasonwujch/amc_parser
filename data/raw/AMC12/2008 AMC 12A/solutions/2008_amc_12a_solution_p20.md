## Problem

Triangle $ABC$ has $AC=3$ , $BC=4$ , and $AB=5$ . Point $D$ is on $\overline{AB}$ , and $\overline{CD}$ bisects the right angle. The inscribed circles of $\triangle ADC$ and $\triangle BCD$ have radii $r_a$ and $r_b$ , respectively. What is $r_a/r_b$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{1}{28}\left(10-\sqrt{2}\right)\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{3}{56}\left(10-\sqrt{2}\right)\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \frac{1}{14}\left(10-\sqrt{2}\right)\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \frac{5}{56}\left(10-\sqrt{2}\right)\\\mathrm{(E)}\ \frac{3}{28}\left(10-\sqrt{2}\right)$

## Solution 1
By the Angle Bisector Theorem , \[\frac{BD}{4} = \frac{5-BD}{3} \Longrightarrow BD = \frac{20}7\] By Law of Sines on $\triangle BCD$ , \[\frac{BD}{\sin 45^{\circ}} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle B} \Longrightarrow \frac{20/7}{\sqrt{2}/2} = \frac{CD}{3/5} \Longrightarrow CD=\frac{12\sqrt{2}}{7}\] Since the area of a triangle satisfies $[\triangle]=rs$ , where $r =$ the inradius and $s =$ the semiperimeter , we have \[\frac{r_A}{r_B} = \frac{[ACD] \cdot s_B}{[BCD] \cdot s_A}\] Since $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle BCD$ share the altitude (to $\overline{AB}$ ), their areas are the ratio of their bases, or \[\frac{[ACD]}{[BCD]} = \frac{AD}{BD} = \frac{3}{4}\] The semiperimeters are $s_A = \left(3 + \frac{15}{7} + \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{7}\right)\left/\right.2 = \frac{18+6\sqrt{2}}{7}$ and $s_B = \frac{24+ 6\sqrt{2}}{7}$ . Thus, \begin{align*} \frac{r_A}{r_B} &= \frac{[ACD] \cdot s_B}{[BCD] \cdot s_A} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{(24+ 6\sqrt{2})/7}{(18+6\sqrt{2})/7} \\ &= \frac{3(4+\sqrt{2})}{4(3+\sqrt{2})} \cdot \left(\frac{3-\sqrt{2}}{3-\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{3}{28}(10-\sqrt{2}) \Rightarrow \mathrm{(E)}\qquad \blacksquare \end{align*}

## Solution 2
We start by finding the length of $AD$ and $BD$ as in solution 1. Using the angle bisector theorem, we see that $AD = \frac{15}{7}$ and $BD = \frac{20}{7}$ . Using Stewart's Theorem gives us the equation $5d^2 + \frac{1500}{49} = \frac{240}{7} + \frac{180}{7}$ , where $d$ is the length of $CD$ . Solving gives us $d = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{7}$ , so $CD = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{7}$ .
Call the incenters of triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$ $O_a$ and $O_b$ respectively. Since $O_a$ is an incenter, it lies on the angle bisector of $\angle ACD$ . Similarly, $O_b$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BCD$ . Call the point on $CD$ tangent to $O_a$ $M$ , and the point tangent to $O_b$ $N$ . Since $\triangle CO_aM$ and $\triangle CO_bN$ are right, and $\angle O_aCM = \angle O_bCN$ , $\triangle CO_aM \sim \triangle CO_bN$ . Then, $\frac{r_a}{r_b} = \frac{CM}{CN}$ .
We now use common tangents to find the length of $CM$ and $CN$ . Let $CM = m$ , and the length of the other tangents be $n$ and $p$ . Since common tangents are equal, we can write that $m + n = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{7}$ , $n + p = \frac{15}{7}$ and $m + p = 3$ . Solving gives us that $CM = m = \frac{6\sqrt{2} + 3}{7}$ . Similarly, $CN = \frac{6\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}$ .
We see now that $\frac{r_a}{r_b} = \frac{\frac{6\sqrt{2} + 3}{7}}{\frac{6\sqrt{2} + 4}{7}} = \frac{6\sqrt{2} + 3}{6\sqrt{2} + 4} = \frac{60-6\sqrt{2}}{56} = \frac{3}{28}(10 - \sqrt{2}) \Rightarrow \boxed{E}$
