# 2008 AMC 12A Problem 5

## Problem

Suppose that \[\frac{2x}{3}-\frac{x}{6}\] is an integer. Which of the following statements must be true about $x$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \text{It is negative.}\\\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{It is even, but not necessarily a multiple of 3.}\\\mathrm{(C)}\ \text{It is a multiple of 3, but not necessarily even.}\\\mathrm{(D)}\ \text{It is a multiple of 6, but not necessarily a multiple of 12.}\\\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{It is a multiple of 12.}$

## Solution
\[\frac{2x}{3}-\frac{x}{6}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{4x}{6}-\frac{x}{6}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{3x}{6}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{x}{2}\] For $\frac{x}{2}$ to be an integer, $x$ must be even, but not necessarily divisible by $3$ . Thus, the answer is $\mathrm{(B)}$ .
