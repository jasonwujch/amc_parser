# 2008 AMC 12A Problem 18

## Problem

Triangle $ABC$ , with sides of length $5$ , $6$ , and $7$ , has one vertex on the positive $x$ -axis, one on the positive $y$ -axis, and one on the positive $z$ -axis. Let $O$ be the origin . What is the volume of tetrahedron $OABC$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \sqrt{85}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \sqrt{90}\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \sqrt{95}\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 10\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \sqrt{105}$

## Solution
Without loss of generality, let $A$ be on the $x$ axis, $B$ be on the $y$ axis, and $C$ be on the $z$ axis, and let $AB, BC, CA$ have respective lengths of 5, 6, and 7. Let $a,b,c$ denote the lengths of segments $OA,OB,OC,$ respectively. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem , \begin{align*} a^2+b^2 &=5^2 , \\ b^2+c^2&=6^2, \\ c^2+a^2 &=7^2 , \end{align*} so $a^2 = (5^2+7^2-6^2)/2 = 19$ ; similarly, $b^2 = 6$ and $c^2 = 30$ . Since $OA$ , $OB$ , and $OC$ are mutually perpendicular, the tetrahedron's volume is \[abc/6\] because we can consider the tetrahedron to be a right triangular pyramid. \[abc/6 = \sqrt{a^2b^2c^2}/6 = \frac{\sqrt{19 \cdot 6 \cdot 30}}{6} = \sqrt{95},\] which is answer choice $\boxed{\text{C}}$ .
