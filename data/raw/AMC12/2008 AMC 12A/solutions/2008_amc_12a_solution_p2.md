## Problem

What is the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{6}{7}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{7}{6}\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \frac{5}{3}\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 3\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \frac{7}{2}$

## Solution 1
Here's a cheapshot: Obviously, $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}$ is greater than $1$ . Therefore, its reciprocal is less than $1$ , and the answer must be $\boxed{\frac{6}{7}}$ .

## Solution 2
$\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}\right)^{-1}=\left(\frac{3}{6}+\frac{4}{6}\right)^{-1}=\left(\frac{7}{6}\right)^{-1}=\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{6}{7}}$ .
