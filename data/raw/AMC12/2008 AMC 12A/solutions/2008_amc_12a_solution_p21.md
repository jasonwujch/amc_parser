## Problem

A permutation $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)$ of $(1,2,3,4,5)$ is heavy-tailed if $a_1 + a_2 < a_4 + a_5$ . What is the number of heavy-tailed permutations?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 36\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 40\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 44\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 48\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 52$

## Solution 1 (Symmetry)
There are $5!=120$ total permutations.
For every permutation $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)$ such that $a_1 + a_2 < a_4 + a_5$ , there is exactly one permutation such that $a_1 + a_2 > a_4 + a_5$ . Thus it suffices to count the permutations such that $a_1 + a_2 = a_4 + a_5$ .
$1+4=2+3$ , $1+5=2+4$ , and $2+5=3+4$ are the only combinations of numbers that can satisfy $a_1 + a_2 = a_4 + a_5$ .
There are $3$ combinations of numbers, $2$ possibilities of which side of the equation is $a_1+a_2$ and which side is $a_4+a_5$ , and $2^2=4$ possibilities for rearranging $a_1,a_2$ and $a_4,a_5$ . Thus, there are $3\cdot2\cdot4=24$ permutations such that $a_1 + a_2 = a_4 + a_5$ .
Thus, the number of heavy-tailed permutations is $\frac{120-24}{2}=48 \Rightarrow D$ .

## Solution 2 (Casework)
We use case work on the value of $a_3$ .
Case 1: $a_3 = 1$ . Since $a_1 + a_2 < a_4 + a_5$ , $(a_1, a_2)$ can only be a permutation of $(2, 3)$ or $(2, 4)$ . The values of $a_1$ and $a_2$ , as well as the values of $a_4$ and $a_5$ , are interchangeable, so this case produces a total of $2(2 \cdot 2) = 8$ solutions.
Case 2: $a_3 = 2$ . Similarly, we have $(a_1, a_2)$ is a permutation of $(1, 3)$ , $(1, 4)$ , or $(1, 5)$ , which gives a total of $3(2 \cdot 2) = 12$ solutions.
Case 3: $a_3 = 3$ . $(a_1, a_2)$ is a permutation of $(1, 2)$ or $(1, 4)$ , which gives a total of $2(2 \cdot 2) = 8$ solutions.
Case 4: $a_3 = 4$ . $(a_1, a_2)$ is a permutation of $(1, 2)$ , $(1, 3)$ , or $(2, 3)$ , which gives a total of $3(2 \cdot 2) = 12$ solutions.
Case 5: $a_3 = 5$ . $(a_1, a_2)$ is a permutation of $(1, 2)$ or $(1, 3)$ , which gives a total of $2(2 \cdot 2) = 8$ solutions.
Therefore, our answer is $8 + 12 + 8 + 12 + 8 = 48 \Rightarrow \boxed{D}$ .
