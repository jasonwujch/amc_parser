## Problem

A flower bouquet contains pink roses, red roses, pink carnations, and red carnations. One third of the pink flowers are roses, three fourths of the red flowers are carnations, and six tenths of the flowers are pink. What percent of the flowers are carnations?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 40\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 60\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 70$

## Solution
We are given that $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$ of the flowers are pink, so we know $\frac{2}{5}$ of the flowers are red.
Since $\frac{1}{3}$ of the pink flowers are roses, $\frac{2}{3}$ of the pink flowers are carnations.
We are given that $\frac{3}{4}$ of the red flowers are carnations.
The percent of flowers that are carnations is
$\frac{3}{5} * \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{5} * \frac{3}{4} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{10} = \frac{7}{10} = 70\%$ , which is $E$
