# 2013 AMC 12A Problem 5

## Problem

Tom, Dorothy, and Sammy went on a vacation and agreed to split the costs evenly. During their trip Tom paid $ $105$ , Dorothy paid $ $125$ , and Sammy paid $ $175$ . In order to share the costs equally, Tom gave Sammy $t$ dollars, and Dorothy gave Sammy $d$ dollars. What is $t-d$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 25\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 30\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 35$

## Solution 1
Simply write down two algebraic equations. We know that Tom gave $t$ dollars and Dorothy gave $d$ dollars. In addition, Tom originally paid $105$ dollars and Dorothy paid $125$ dollars originally. Since they all pay the same amount, we have: \[105 + t = 125 + d.\] Rearranging, we have \[t-d = \boxed{\textbf{(B)} 20}.\]

## Solution 2
Add up the amounts that Tom, Dorothy, and Sammy paid to get \$ $405$ , and divide by 3 to get \$ $135$ , the amount that each should have paid.
Tom, having paid \$ $105$ , owes Sammy \$ $30$ , and Dorothy, having paid \$ $125$ , owes Sammy \$ $10$ .
Thus, $t - d = 30 - 10 = 20$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$
