## Problem

Let $S$ be the set of positive integers $n$ for which $\tfrac{1}{n}$ has the repeating decimal representation $0.\overline{ab} = 0.ababab\cdots,$ with $a$ and $b$ different digits. What is the sum of the elements of $S$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 11\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 44\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 110\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 143\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 155\qquad$

## Solution 1
Note that $\frac{1}{11} = 0.\overline{09}$ .
Dividing by 3 gives $\frac{1}{33} = 0.\overline{03}$ , and dividing by 9 gives $\frac{1}{99} = 0.\overline{01}$ .
$S = \{11, 33, 99\}$
$11 + 33 + 99 = 143$
The answer must be at least $143$ , but cannot be $155$ since no $n \le 12$ other than $11$ satisfies the conditions, so the answer is $143$ .

## Solution 2
Let us begin by working with the condition $0.\overline{ab} = 0.ababab\cdots,$ . Let $x = 0.ababab\cdots$ . So, $100x-x = ab \Rightarrow x = \frac{ab}{99}$ . In order for this fraction $x$ to be in the form $\frac{1}{n}$ , $99$ must be a multiple of $ab$ . Hence the possibilities of $ab$ are $1,3,9,11,33,99$ . Checking each of these, $\frac{1}{99} = 0.\overline{01}, \frac{3}{99}=\frac{1}{33} = 0.\overline{03}, \frac{9}{99}=\frac{1}{11} = 0.\overline{09}, \frac{11}{99}=\frac{1}{9} = 0.\overline{1}, \frac{33}{99} =\frac{1}{3}= 0.\overline{3},$ and $\frac{99}{99} = 1$ . So the only values of $n$ that have distinct $a$ and $b$ are $11,33,$ and $99$ . So, $11+33+99= \boxed{\textbf{(D)} 143}$

## Solution 3
Notice that we have $\frac{100}{n}= ab.\overline{ab}$
We can subtract $\frac{1}{n}=00.\overline{ab}$ to get \[\frac{99}{n}=ab\]
From this we determine $n$ must be a positive factor of $99$
The factors of $99$ are $1,3,9,11,33,$ and $99$ .
For $n=1,3,$ and $9$ however, they yield $ab=99,33$ and $11$ which doesn't satisfy $a$ and $b$ being distinct.
For $n=11,33$ and $99$ we have $ab=09,03$ and $01$ . (Notice that $a$ or $b$ can be zero)
The sum of these $n$ are $11+33+99=143$
$\boxed{\textbf{(D)} 143}$

## Solution 4
As in previous solutions, we have $n|99$ and $\overline{ab} = 99/n$ . If we had $a=b$ , the decimal would be $0.\overline{a}$ , which is characterized by $n|9$ and $a = 9/n$ . So we seek the sum of the factors of 99 that are not also factors of 9.
Since $99 = 3^2 \cdot 11$ , the sum is $(1 + 3 + 9)(1 + 11) - (1 + 3 + 9) = 13(12 - 1) = \textbf{(D)} 143$ .
