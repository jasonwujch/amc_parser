# 2013 AMC 12A Problem 7

## Problem

The sequence $S_1, S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_{10}$ has the property that every term beginning with the third is the sum of the previous two. That is, \[S_n = S_{n-2} + S_{n-1} \text{ for } n \ge 3.\] Suppose that $S_9 = 110$ and $S_7 = 42$ . What is $S_4$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 16\qquad$

## Solution
$S_9 = 110$ , $S_7 = 42$
$S_8 = S_9 - S_ 7 = 110 - 42 = 68$
$S_6 = S_8 - S_7 = 68 - 42 = 26$
$S_5 = S_7 - S_6 = 42 - 26 = 16$
$S_4 = S_6 - S_5 = 26 - 16 = 10$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }{10}}$
