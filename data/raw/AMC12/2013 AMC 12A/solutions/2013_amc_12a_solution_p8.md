## Problem

Given that $x$ and $y$ are distinct nonzero real numbers such that $x+\tfrac{2}{x} = y + \tfrac{2}{y}$ , what is $xy$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 4\qquad$

## Solution 1
$x+\tfrac{2}{x}= y+\tfrac{2}{y}$
Since $x\not=y$ , we may assume that $x=\frac{2}{y}$ and/or, equivalently, $y=\frac{2}{x}$ .
Cross multiply in either equation, giving us $xy=2$ .
$\boxed{\textbf{(D) }{2}}$

## Solution 2
$x+\tfrac{2}{x}= y+\tfrac{2}{y}$
$x-y+\frac{2}{x}-\frac{2}{y} = 0$
$(x-y)+2(\frac{y-x}{xy}) = 0$
$(x-y)(1-\frac{2}{xy})=0$
Since $x\not=y$
$1 = \frac{2}{xy}$
$xy = 2$

## Solution 3
Let $A = x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}.$ Consider the equation \[u + \frac{2}{u} = A.\] Reorganizing, we see that $u$ satisfies \[u^2 - Au + 2 = 0.\] Notice that there can be at most two distinct values of $u$ which satisfy this equation, and $x$ and $y$ are two distinct possible values for $u.$ Therefore, $x$ and $y$ are roots of this quadratic, and by Vieta’s formulas we see that $xy$ thereby must equal $\boxed{2}.$

## Solution 4
\[x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}.\]
Multiply both sides by xy to get
\[x^2y + 2y = y^2x +2x\]
Rearrange to get
\[x^2y - y^2x = 2x - 2y\]
Factor out $xy$ on the left side and $2$ on the right side to get
\[xy(x-y) = 2(x-y)\]
Divide by $(x-y)$ {You can do this since x and y are distinct} to get
$\boxed{\textbf{(D) }{2}}$
