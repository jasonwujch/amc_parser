# 2025 AMC 12B Problem 3

## Problem

What is the value of $i(i-1)(i-2)(i-3)$ , where $i = \sqrt{-1}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}~6-5i \qquad \textbf{(B)}~-10i \qquad \textbf{(C)}~10i \qquad \textbf{(D)}~-10 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~10$

## Solution
We find that $i(i-3)=-1-3i$ and $(i-1)(i-2)=-1-3i+2=1-3i$ , so \begin{align} i(i-1)(i-2)(i-3)&=i(i-3)\cdot (i-1)(i-2)\\ &=(-1-3i)(1-3i)\\ &=-(1+3i)(1-3i)\\ &=-(1^2-(3i)^2)\\ &=-(1+9)\\ &=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~-10 } \end{align}
