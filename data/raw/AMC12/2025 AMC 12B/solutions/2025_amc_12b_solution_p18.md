## Problem

Awnik repeatedly plays a game that has a probability of winning of $\frac{1}{3}$ . The outcomes of the games are independent. What is the expected value of the number of games he will play until he has both won and lost at least once?

$\textbf{(A) } \frac{5}{2} \qquad \textbf{(B) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(C) } \frac{16}{5} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{7}{2} \qquad \textbf{(E) } \frac{15}{4}$

## Solution 1
Let the probability of a win be $p$ and the probability of a loss be $q$ . If the first game is a win, then we must find the expected number of further games to get a loss, which will be $\frac{1}{q}$ . In addition to the first game played, there will be $1+\frac{1}{q}$ games played. Therefore, the expected number of games needed to get a win on game $1$ and then a loss is $(p)\left(1+\frac{1}{q}\right).$
Similarly, if the first game is a loss, we need to the find the expected number of further games to get a win, which will be $\frac{1}{p}$ . There will be a total of $1+\frac{1}{p}$ games played. Therefore, the expected number of games needed to get a loss on game $1$ and then a win is $(q)\left(1+\frac{1}{p}\right).$
The answer is \[(p)\left(1+\frac{1}{q}\right) + (q)\left(1+\frac{1}{p}\right)\] \[\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1+\frac{3}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)(1+3) = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{8}{3} = \boxed{\frac{7}{2}}.\]

## Solution 2 (First-step analysis)
Note that if we stop after getting at least one win and one loss, then the stopping condition is the first state change. If we start with a win, then we count the expected number of rounds until we lose and vice versa.
We use first-step analysis: \[\mathbb{E}[T]=1+\sum_{s\in \Omega}\mathbb{P}(s)\mathbb{E}[T-1|s]\] Here, we have $\mathbb{P}(W)=\frac{1}{3}, \mathbb{P}(L)=\frac{2}{3}$ .
Using first-step analysis on each condition expectation, by the Markov property \[\mathbb{E}[T|W]=1+\mathbb{P}(W)\mathbb{E}[T|W]+\mathbb{P}(L)(0)=1+\mathbb{P}(W)\mathbb{E}[T|W]\] Solving, $\mathbb{E}[T|W]=\frac{1}{1-\mathbb{P}(W)}=\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}(L)}$ . Similarly, $\mathbb{E}[T|L]=\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}(W)}$ . Write $p=\mathbb{P}(W)$ . $q=\mathbb{P}(L)=1-p$ . \[\mathbb{E}[T]=1+\mathbb{P}(W)\mathbb{E}[T|W]+\mathbb{P}(L)\mathbb{E}[T|L]=1+p\left( \frac{1}{q} \right)+q\left( \frac{1}{p} \right)=1+\frac{p}{q}+\frac{q}{p}=1+\frac{p^2+q^2}{pq}\] We can simplify using $(p+q)^2=1=p^2+q^2+2pq$ , giving $p^2+q^2=1-2pq$ . Therefore, \[\mathbb{E}[T]=1+\frac{1-2pq}{pq}=1+\frac{1}{pq}-2=\frac{1}{pq}-1\] Substituting $p=\frac{1}{3}$ , $q=\frac{2}{3}$ yields $3\cdot \frac{3}{2}-1=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac{7}{2}}$ .
