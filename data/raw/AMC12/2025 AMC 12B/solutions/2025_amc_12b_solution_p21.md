## Problem

Two non-congruent triangles have the same area. Each triangle has sides of length $8$ and $9$ , and the third side of each triangle has integer length. What is the sum of the lengths of the third sides?

$\textbf{(A) } 20 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 22 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 24 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 26 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 28$

## Solution 1
Let the angles between the $8$ and $9$ sides be $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ . Relating the two triangles' areas, we get \[\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot \sin{\theta_1} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot \sin{\theta_2}\] \[\sin{\theta_1} = \sin{\theta_2}\] For this to be true, $\theta_1 + \theta_2 = 180.$ We will now apply Law of Cosines to get an expression for $s_1$ and $s_2$ in terms of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ . \[s_1^2 = 8^2 + 9^2 - (2)(8)(9)\cos(\theta_1)\] \[s_2^2 = 8^2 + 9^2 - (2)(8)(9)\cos(180-\theta_1).\] Noting that $\cos{\theta_1} = -\cos{(180 - \theta_1)}$ , we can add the two equations to get that \[s_1^2 + s_2^2 = 290.\] We now need two perfect squares that add to $290$ . After some analysis, we find $121 + 169 = 290$ . Therefore, $s_1 = 11$ and $s_2 = 13$ , so our answer is $11 + 13 = \boxed{24}.$ Note that the $\cos{\theta_1} = 1/6.$ Also, note that $289 + 1 = 290$ , but $17$ and $1$ are not valid side lengths due to the Triangle Inequality.

## Solution 2 (Heron)
Let the third sides be $a$ and $b$ . Say the third sides is $x$ , where $x$ is a dummy variable. Then, by Heron’s Formula, the area of the triangle is \[\sqrt{\frac{x+17}{2}\cdot\frac{x+1}{2}\cdot\frac{x-1}{2}\cdot\frac{17-x}{2}}=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(17^2-x^2)(x^2-1^2)}\] Since the areas are the same, this value when $x=a$ is the same as this value when $x=b$ . In other words, \[\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(17^2-a^2)(a^2-1^2)}=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(17^2-b^2)(b^2-1^2)}\] equivalent to \[(289-a^2)(a^2-1)=(289-b^2)(b^2-1)=c\] for some constant $c$ .
But if we consider the quadratic \[(289-y)(y-1)=c\] we know that the two roots must be $y=a^2$ and $y=b^2$ . Expanding the quadratic, we get \[y^2-290y+289+c=0\] By Vieta’s Formulas, we must have $a^2+b^2=290$ . Casework yields $a=11,b=13$ (or vice versa) as the only solutions, so the sum is $a+b=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 24}$ .

## Solution 3 (Slight difference to Solution 1)
Denote the angle that is between side lengths $8$ and $9$ as angle $A$ , the other triangle will be $180^\circ - A$ , because by the area formula of $\frac{1}{2}a\cdot b\cdot\sin C$ , the $\sin C$ needs to remain constant while $a$ and $b$ stay the same to keep the area the same. Denote the shorter third side as $x$ and longer third side as $y$ .
By applying the Law of Cosines, $y^2 = 8^2 + 9^2 - 2 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot \cos(180- A)$ , which gives $y^2 = 145 + 144\cos A$ . Similarly, $x^2 = 145 - 144\cos A$ . Since the question says the third lengths are both integers, try testing values of $\cos A$ . Notice when $\cos A = \frac{1}{6}$ , $y^2 = 169$ and $x^2 = 121$ , giving the lengths as $13$ and $11$ respectively. The required answer is then $13 + 11 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 24}$ .

## Solution 4 (Sine/Cosine Law + Quadratic Residues)
As in other solutions, use sine law to check $\beta=180-\alpha$ , $\cos\alpha=-\cos\beta$ . Apply cosine law $x^2,y^2=8^2+9^2\mp 2(8)(9)\cos\alpha=145\mp 144\cos\alpha$ and and verify integer solutions to $x^2+y^2=2(8^2+9^2)=290$ .
Since $\alpha>0$ , we need $\cos\alpha<1$ so $(1,289)=(1^2,17^2)$ is not valid. WLOG $2\le x<y\le 16$ . To help with the bash, note the quadratic residues mod $3$ and $4$ are $0,1$ , so it must be $1+1\equiv 2$ , so we only need to check odd cases not divisible by $3$ , so $x=5,7,11,13$ .
$290-25=265$ bad
$290-49=241$ bad
$290-121=169$ good, stop by symmetry.
So $(x,y)=(11,13)$ , giving $x+y=11+13=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 24}$ .
