## Problem

Three concentric circles have radii $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ . An equilateral triangle of side length $s$ has one vertex on each circle. What is $s^{2}$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}~6 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~\frac{25}{4} \qquad \textbf{(C)}~\frac{13}{2} \qquad \textbf{(D)}~\frac{27}{4} \qquad \textbf{(E)}~7$

## Solution 1
Let $\triangle ABC$ and center $O$ be such that $OA=1, OB=2, OC=3$ . Suppose the length of the side of $ABC$ is $s$ . Noticing that $OA + OB = OC$ , we suspect that $OACB$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. If it was, we could apply Ptolemy's Theorem, which would say that \[CB \cdot OA + OB \cdot AC = OC \cdot AB\] \[s + 2s = 3s.\] Because Ptolemy's is true, $OACB$ is cyclic. Because it's cyclic, $\angle AOB = 180 - \angle BCA = 120$ . Applying Law of Cosines on $AOB$ , we get \[s^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 - 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cos{120}\] \[s^2 = 1 + 4 +2 = \boxed{7}.\]

## Solution 2
Call the point that lies on the circle $r = 1$ as $A$ , $r = 2$ as $B$ and $r = 3$ as $C$ .
We could set $A = (1, 0)$ , $B = (2\cos B, 2\sin B)$ and $C = (3\cos C, 3\sin C)$
$s = BA = CB = CA$ .
\[BA = (2\cos B - 1)^2 + (2\sin B)^2 = 5 - 4\cos B\]
\[CA = (3\cos C - 1)^2 + (3\sin C)^2 = 10 - 6\cos C\]
\[CB = (3\cos C - 2\cos B)^2 + (3\sin C - 2\sin B)^2 = 13 - 12\cos(B - C)\]
Let $\cos B = x$ and $\cos C = y$ for easier representation
Because $5 - 4\cos B = 10 - 6\cos C$ , hence $x =\frac{6y-5}{4}$
Also, $5 - 4\cos B = 13 - 12\cos(B - C)$ , which $12\cos(B - C) = 8 + 4\cos B = 8 + 4\cdot\frac{6y-5}{4} = 3 + 6y$ , leading to $\cos(B - C) = \frac{1+2y}{4}$
Noting that \[\cos(B - C) = xy + \sqrt{1-x^{2}}\sqrt{1-y^{2}} = \frac{1+2y}{4}\] \[1 - x^2 = 1 - (\frac{6y-5}{4})^2 = \frac{-36y^2 + 60y - 9}{16}\]
let $K= \sqrt{1-x^{2}}\sqrt{1-y^{2}}$ , which the equation $xy + \sqrt{1-x^{2}}\sqrt{1-y^{2}} = \frac{1+2y}{4}$ can be simplified to $\frac{y(6y-5)}{4} + K = \frac{1+2y}{4}$
By rearranging, the equation $\frac{y(6y-5)}{4} + K = \frac{1+2y}{4}$ turns into $K = \frac{-6y^2 + 7y + 1}{4}$
Squaring both sides, which \[K^2 = (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = \frac{(-6y^2 + 7y + 1)^2}{16}\] Substituting in $1 - x^2 = \frac{-36y^2 + 60y - 9}{16}$ , we get \[(-6y^2 + 7y + 1)^2 = (-36y^2 + 60y - 9)(1 - y^2)\]
By expanding, $LHS = 36y^4 - 84y^3 + 37y^2 + 14y + 1$ and $RHS = 36y^4 - 60y^3 - 27y^2 + 60y - 9$
Rearrange it, we get \[12y^3 - 32y^2 + 23y - 5 = 0\]
By inspection (which $y$ cant be greater than 1 because it is a cosine value), let’s try $y = \frac{1}{2}$ : it is a root.
By polynomial division, this becomes \[(2y - 1)(6y^2 - 13y + 5) = 0\]
The other $2$ solutions from the quadratic are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{5}{3}$ (greater than $1$ , rejected), meaning that the only $y$ possible value is $\frac{1}{2}$ .
Because length of $CA = (3\cos C - 1)^2 + (3\sin C)^2 = 10 - 6\cos C$ , hence the answer is $10 - 6(1/2) = 10 - 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)} \ 7}.$

## Solution 3 (rotation)
Let $A$ be a point on the circle with radius $1$ , $B$ be a point on the circle with radius $2$ , $C$ be a point on the circle with radius $3$ . Call the shared center for these three circles $O$ . First let’s check if $O$ is in $\triangle ABC$ . Rotate $OA$ clockwise by $60^{\circ}$ to $OA’$ , then it is equivalent to check if point $A’$ is outside $\triangle ABC$ . Assume that $A’$ is outside $\triangle ABC$ , easy to prove that $\triangle AOC\cong \triangle AA’B$ . Therefore $OC=A’B=3$ , in $\triangle OA’B$ , \[OA’+OB=1+2=3=A’B\] This violates the triangle inequality. Thus $A’$ must be inside $\triangle ABC$ in order to let the shape make sense. Easy to prove $\triangle AOB\cong \triangle AA’C$ , therefore $A’C=2$ . And by rotation $OA’=1$ . Also notice that $OC=3$ , which means $OA’+A’C=OC$ , this means $O$ , $A’$ , $C$ must be collinear. Since $\angle AOA’=\angle AA’O=60^{\circ}$ , $\angle AA’C=120^{\circ}$ , then use Law of Cosines in $\triangle AA’C$ : \[s^{2}=AC^{2}=1^{2}+2^{2}-2\cdot 1\cdot{2}\cdot\cos 120^{\circ}=\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \ 7}\] ~Augustusgao

## Solution 5
Let $O$ be the common center and let the vertices of the triangle $A,B,C$ satisfy $OA=1$ , $OB=2$ , $OC=3$ , with side length $AB=BC=CA=s$ . Let $x=s^{2}$ . Let $\alpha=\angle AOB$ , $\beta=\angle BOC$ , $\gamma=\angle COA$ , so $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=360^\circ$ . By the Law of Cosines,
\[x = 1^2+2^2-2\cdot1\cdot2\cos\alpha = 5-4\cos\alpha \Rightarrow \cos\alpha = \frac{5-x}{4}\] \[x = 2^2+3^2-2\cdot2\cdot3\cos\beta = 13-12\cos\beta \Rightarrow \cos\beta = \frac{13-x}{12}\] \[x = 3^2+1^2-2\cdot3\cdot1\cos\gamma = 10-6\cos\gamma \Rightarrow \cos\gamma = \frac{10-x}{6}\]
For angles summing to $360^\circ$ , we have
\[\cos^2\alpha+\cos^2\beta+\cos^2\gamma - 2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma = 1\] Substitute $\cos\alpha,\cos\beta,\cos\gamma$ in terms of $x$ and plug in answer choices (don't bother trying to solve it), we get $x = \boxed{7}$ .

## Solution 6
Let $\omega_1$ be a circle of radius $1$ centered at $O=(0, 0)$ . Let $\omega_2$ be a circle of radius $2$ centered at $(0, 0)$ . Let $A$ be the point $(0, 3)$ . Let $B$ be some point on $\omega_1$ . Let $C$ be some point in the plane such that $ABC$ is equilateral. Our goal is to find some $C$ that lies on $\omega_2$ .
Because $\angle BAC=60^\circ$ and $AB=AC$ , we see that $C$ must be the rotation of $B$ around $A$ , either $60^\circ$ clockwise or counterclockwise. Note that because the locus of all points $B$ is $\omega_1$ , the locus of all points $C$ is the two circles formed by rotating $\omega_1$ $60^\circ$ around $A$ , either direction.
We want a $C$ that lies on $\omega_2$ , so we naturally intersect $\omega_2$ with one of these two circles (I chose the one that's rotated counterclockwise because the numbers are nicer). We could easily calculate the intersections using coord geo, but notice that the problem asks for a unique $s$ ; this means that the circle is tangent to $\omega_2$ . The tangent point, which is the only $C$ that works, lies on the line connecting the centers. The center (denote it $O'$ ) of (half of) $C$ 's locus is the center of $\omega_2$ rotated $60^\circ$ counterclockwise. Because $AO=AO'$ and $\angle OAO'=60^\circ$ , we see $\triangle OAO'$ is equilateral, meaning $\angle AOO'=\angle AOC=60^\circ$ , which means by extension that $C$ is $30^\circ$ counterclockwise from the horizontal. $OC=2$ as $C$ lies on $\omega_2$ , so the coordinates of $C$ are at $(2\cos 30^\circ, 2\sin 30^\circ)=(\sqrt{3}, 1)$ . $A$ is at $(0, 3)$ , and a quick distance formula gives us $s^2=(C.x-A.x)^2+(C.y+A.y)^2=3+4=\boxed{7}$ . ~JoeyG
