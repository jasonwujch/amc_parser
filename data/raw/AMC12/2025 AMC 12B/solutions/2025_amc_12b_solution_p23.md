# 2025 AMC 12B Problem 23

## Problem

Let $S$ be the set of all integers $z > 1$ such that for all pairs of nonnegative integers $(x, y)$ with $x < y < z$ , the remainder when $2025x$ is divided by $z$ is less than the remainder when $2025y$ is divided by $z$ . What is the sum of the elements of $S$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}~3041 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~3542 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~3750 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~4044 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~4319$

## Solution 1
Notice that there are $z$ distinct remainders modulo $z$ . However, if we let $R(x)$ denote the remainder when $2025x$ is divided by $z$ , we know that by the problem condition, \[R(0)<R(1)<R(2)<\cdots<R(z-1)\] But there are only $z$ distinct remainders, and each of the $z$ terms above must correspond to a distinct remainder, so we must have $R(k)=k$ for all $k=0,1,\dots,z-1$ . Then $2025k\equiv k\pmod{z}$ , so $2024k\equiv 0\pmod{z}$ . Since $k$ can vary, this is equivalent to $2024\equiv 0\pmod{z}$ , or $z\mid 2024$ .
Therefore, the values $z$ that satisfy the property are the factors of $2024$ , so we simply need to find the sum of the factors of $2024$ and subtract $1$ at the end since $z\ne 1$ . But $2024=2^3\cdot 11\cdot 23$ , so the sum of the factors minus $1$ is \[(1+2+4+8)(1+11)(1+23)-1=15\cdot12\cdot24-1=4320-1=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~4319 }.\]

## Solution 2 (Fast)
Notice that $2025x \equiv x \pmod{z} \, \forall z \mid 2024$ . Since $x<y<z$ , all pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the remainder condition when $z\mid 2024$ except for $z=1$ . Recall that $2024=2^3\cdot 11 \cdot 23$ , so $\sum z=(15)(12)(24)-1=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~4319}$ , which is the largest answer choice.
