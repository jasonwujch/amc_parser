## Problem

The windshield wiper on the driver's side of a large bus is depicted below. [asy] /* Made by MRENTHUSIASM */ size(200); pair A, B, C, D; A = origin; B = (3/2,3*sqrt(3)/2); C = B+(0,1.75); D = B-(0,1.75); draw(A--B,linewidth(1.1)); draw(C--D,red+linewidth(1.1)); dot(A^^B,linewidth(5)); label("$A$",A,1.5*W); label("$B$",B,1.5*E); label("$C$",C,1.5*E); label("$D$",D,1.5*E); [/asy] Arm $\overline{AB}$ pivots back and forth around point $A$ , sweeping out an arc of $60^{\circ}$ , symmetric about the vertical line through $A$ . The wiper blade $\overline{CD}$ is attached to $B$ at its midpoint and stays vertical as the arm moves. The arm is $3$ feet long, and the wiper blade is $3.5$ feet tall. What is the area of the windshield cleaned by the wiper, in square feet, to the nearest hundredth? (Assume that the windshield is a flat vertical surface.)

$\textbf{(A) } 9.68 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 10.14 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 10.50 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 11.32 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 12.00$

## Solution 1 (Cavalieri's Principle)
The area cleaned by the wiper follows a thickened curve with vertical ends, where the curve is a $60^\circ$ arc with radius $3$ . Since the sides are vertical, by Cavalieri's Principle, the area is equivalent to a rectangle with side lengths $3.5$ and the distance between the two vertical ends. Let $B'$ be the result of point $B$ at its leftmost point after it has swept $60^\circ$ . Then $ABB'$ is equilateral so $BB' = AB = 3$ . So the area is $3.5 \cdot 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 10.50}$ .
Note: if you aren't aware of Cavalieri's Principle, you can still recognize this by slicing the top curved part of the shape and moving it to the bottom, creating a rectangle with the same area as the original shape.

## Solution 2 (Calculus)
As solution 1 kind of explains, the top and bottom of the area swept out follow the exact same path shape, so we can think of the top one as $f(x)$ and the bottom one as $f(x)-3.5$ . As solution 1 points out, the width of the figure is 3. Then, the area between them is $\int_{0}^{3}[f(x)-(f(x)-3.5)]dx = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 10.50}$ .
