# 2025 AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

Positive integers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $57x+ 22y = 400$ . What is the least possible value of $x+y$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 10 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 11 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 13 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 14 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 15$

## Solution 1
Let $x+y = a$ . Then we have the equation \[35x + 22a = 400.\] Because the other two terms are divisible by $5$ , $22a$ must be divisible by $5$ too. Specifically, $a$ is divisible by $5$ . Let $a=5b$ and substitute: \[35x + 110b = 400\] \[7x + 22b = 80.\] After some analysis, we find that if $b=3$ , $x = 2$ . In fact, this is the only solution with positive integer solutions. Therefore, $a = x+y = 5 \cdot 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }15}$ .

## Solution 2 (Extended Euclid Algorithm)
We first solve for integers $x$ and $y$ such that $57x+22y=400$ . Use the Extended Euclid Algorithm to find that \[x_1 = -5, y_1 = 13.\] We multiply both $x_1$ and $y_1$ by 400. Since we require both $x$ and $y$ to be positive integers, let \[x_k = -5 \cdot 400 + 22k\] \[y_k = 13 \cdot 400 - 57k.\] We can check this method of writing $x_k$ and $y_k$ is valid by substitution into the original equation. Finally, we add $x_k$ and $y_k$ , to find \[-5 \cdot 400 + 13 \cdot 400 - 35k.\] We want to minimize this value, and after evaluation we find $3200 - 35k$ . Minimizing this value over the positive integers, we find $k = 91$ , which yields $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }15}$ .

## Solution 3 (Mod 11)
Taking mod $11$ , we see that $2x\equiv_{11}4\iff x\equiv_{11}2$ . This forces $x=2$ as bigger numbers make the sum pass $400$ , so that $y=\frac{400-2\cdot 57}{22}=\frac{200-57}{11}=\frac{143}{11}=13$ . So the answer is $x+y=2+13=\boxed{ \textbf{(E) } 15 }$ .
