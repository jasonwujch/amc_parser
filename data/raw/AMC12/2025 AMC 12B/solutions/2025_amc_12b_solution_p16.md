# 2025 AMC 12B Problem 16

## Problem

An analog clock starts at midnight and runs for $2025$ minutes before stopping. What is the tangent of the acute angle between the hour hand and the minute hand when the clock stops?

$\textbf{(A) } 0 \qquad \textbf{(B) } \sqrt{2}-1 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 2-\sqrt{2} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \qquad \textbf{(E) } 3-\sqrt{2}$

## Solution 1
When divided by $60$ , $2025$ yields $33$ , with a remainder of $45$ . Since $33 \equiv 9 \pmod{24}$ , the clock is now at $9:45$ .
At this time, the hour is $75\%$ over, so the hour hand is also $75\%$ of the way between $9$ and $10$ . There are $360/12 = 30 ^\circ$ degrees between $9$ and $10$ , and since the hour hand is $75\%$ of the way, it is $30^\circ \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{45}{2}^\circ$ from the minute hand, which is pointing directly at $9$ .
We now just need to find $\tan{(45/2)}$ . Let this be $x$ . Using the tangent addition formula, we get that \[\tan{45} = \frac{x + x}{1 - x\cdot x}\] \[1 = \frac{2x}{1-x^2}\] \[x^2+2x-1 = 0.\] Using the Quadratic Formula, and knowing $x$ must be positive since $0 < x < 90$ , we get $x = \tan{(45/2)}= \boxed{\sqrt{2}-1}$

Note: One could solve this quickly using the *tangent half angle identity*, which is $\tan(\frac{\theta}{2}) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{1+\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1-\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}$ ~math660
Note: Another interesting way to find the angle between the hands at 9:45 is to use the formula $30h - \frac{11}{2}m$ , where $h$ is the hour and $m$ is the minute. In this case, we get the angle is $30 \cdot 9 - \frac{11}{2}(45) = \frac{540-495}{2} = \frac{45}{2}$ as desired. ~lprado
