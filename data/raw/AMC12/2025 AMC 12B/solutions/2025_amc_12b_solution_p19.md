# 2025 AMC 12B Problem 19

## Problem

A rectangular grid of squares has $141$ rows and $91$ columns. Each square has room for two numbers. Horace and Vera each fill in the grid by putting the numbers from $1$ through $141 \times 91 = 12{,}831$ into the squares. Horace fills the grid horizontally: he puts $1$ through $91$ in order from left to right into row $1$ , puts $92$ through $182$ into row $2$ in order from left to right, and continues similarly through row $141$ . Vera fills the grid vertically: she puts $1$ through $141$ in order from top to bottom into column $1$ , then $142$ through $282$ into column $2$ in order from top to bottom, and continues similarly through column $91$ . How many squares get two copies of the same number?

$\textbf{(A)}~7 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~10 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~11 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~12 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~19$

## Solution 1
Let's say $n$ is one of the numbers that got written twice in the same box. Suppose it is at column $x$ and row $y$ . We will write an expression for $n$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ in two ways: from Horace's perspective and Vera's perspective.
From Horace's perspective, $n = (y-1)(141) + x$ . This is because there are $y-1$ full rows before $n$ , and we then need $x$ more numbers to reach $n$ . Similarly, Vera will say $n = (x-1)(91) + y$ .
We now have the Diophantine equation \[(y-1)(141) + x = (x-1)(91)+y\] \[141y-141+x = 91x-91+y\] \[140y=90x+50\] \[14y = 9x + 5\] One such solution is, of course, $x=y=1$ . We find further solutions by adding $14$ to $x$ and $9$ to $y$ . For example, the second solution is $(15,10)$ . This continues until $(141,91)$ is reached. There are $\boxed{11}$ ordered pairs in this list.

## Solution 2 (0-indexing)
For these types of problems, we essentially analyze residues, so it is more convenient to work with 0-indexing: $c=0,1,2,\dots,90$ , $r=0,1,2,\dots,140$ .
Then $n=91r+c+1=141c+r+1\iff 9r=14c$ . We must have $(r,c)=(0,0),(14,9),(28,18),\dots,(140,90)$ so $\boxed{ \textbf{(C)}~11 }$ .

## Solution 2 (faster ending)
After indexing to 0, we imagine a line that passes from $(0,0)$ to $(140,90)$ . We know we are looking for all lattice points that lie on this line (this intuitively makes sense, because any points above the line would have column numbers far ahead of the rows, and vice versa).
Therefore, we know that the number of points must divide both $140$ and $90$ . The GCD of the two is 10. We also account for point $(0,0)$ , and get that $10+1=\boxed{ \textbf{(C)}~11 }$ .

## Solution 3
Observe that Horaces number can be expressed as the remainder of the row number plus the column number so $H$ (Horaces Number) $=91(c-1)$ (column addition) $+r$ (remainder of division) and do the same for Vera $V=141(r-1)+c$ .The condition is $H=V$ so set the equations equal to each other. $91(c-1)+r=141(r-1)+c$ so $91c-91+r=141r-141+c$ , $140r=90c+50$ .This a linear Diophantine equation and the 1st solution is $(1,1)$ where the solution repeats every $lcm(90,140)=1260$ there are $11$ solutions so $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}11}$ is correct.
