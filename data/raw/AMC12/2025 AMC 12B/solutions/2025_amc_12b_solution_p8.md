## Problem

There are integers $a$ and $b$ such that the polynomial $x^3 - 5x^2 + ax + b$ has $4+\sqrt{5}$ as a root. What is $a+b$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 13 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 17 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 20 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 30 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 68$

## Solution 1
Because every coefficient of our polynomial $f(x)$ is an integer, the conjugate of $4+\sqrt{5}$ , $4-\sqrt{5}$ is also a root.
Let the third and final root be $r_3$ . Thanks to Vieta's Formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is \[(r_3) + (4+\sqrt{5}) + (4 - \sqrt{5}) = 5\] \[r_3 = -3.\]
We now calculate $f(1) = (1+3)(1-4-\sqrt{5})(1-4+\sqrt{5})$ .
$(1-4-\sqrt{3})(1-4+\sqrt{3}) = (-3-\sqrt{5})(-3+\sqrt{5}) = 9 - 5 = 4.$
So $f(1) = 4 \cdot 4 = 16.$
Hence $f(1) = 16 = 1-5 + a + b$ . Therefore, $a + b = \boxed{20}$ .

## Solution 2
As in Solution 1, we have that $f(x)$ contains roots $4+\sqrt{5}$ and its conjugate $4-\sqrt{5}$ , and that $r_3=-3$ , where $r_3$ is the last root. Hence, we can create a factorization for $f(x)$ and compare coefficients as follows:
$(x+3)(x-(4+\sqrt{5}))(x-(4-\sqrt{5}))=(x+3)(x^2-8x+11)=x^3-8x^2+11x+3x^2-24x+33=x^3-5x^3-13x+33$ , and hence by comparing the coefficients we have that $a+b=-13+33=\boxed{20\hspace{1mm}\textbf{(C)}}$ .

## Solution 3 (Bash)
Since $4+\sqrt{ 5 }$ is a root of polynomial, by definition \[(4+\sqrt{ 5 })^3-5(4+\sqrt{ 5 })^2+a(4+\sqrt{ 5 })+b=0=0+0\sqrt { 5 }\] Since $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$ , we can expand and compare coefficients, \[\begin{cases} 64+3\cdot 4 \cdot 5-5(4^2+5)+4a+b=0 \\ 3\cdot 16+5-5\cdot 2\cdot 4+a=0 \end{cases}\] Solving, $a=-13$ , $b=-4a-19=33$ , so $a+b=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 20}$ .
