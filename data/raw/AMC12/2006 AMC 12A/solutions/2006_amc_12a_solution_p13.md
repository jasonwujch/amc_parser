## Problem

The vertices of a $3-4-5$ right triangle are the centers of three mutually externally tangent circles , as shown. What is the sum of the areas of the three circles?

$\mathrm{(A) \ } 12\pi\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } \frac{25\pi}{2}\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ } 13\pi\qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } \frac{27\pi}{2}\qquad\mathrm{(E) \ } 14\pi$

## Solution
Let the radius of the smallest circle be $r_A$ , the radius of the second largest circle be $r_B$ , and the radius of the largest circle be $r_C$ . \[r_A + r_B = 3\] \[r_A + r_C = 4\] \[r_ B + r_C = 5\]
Adding up all these equations and then dividing both sides by 2, we get,
\[r_A + r_B + r_C = 6\]
Then, we get $r_A = 1$ , $r_B = 2$ , and $r_C = 3$ Then we get $1^2 \pi + 2^2 \pi + 3^2 \pi = 14 \pi \iff\mathrm{(E)}$
