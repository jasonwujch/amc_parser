## Problem

Which of the following describes the graph of the equation $(x+y)^2=x^2+y^2$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \text{the empty set}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one point}\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \text{two lines}\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \text{a circle}\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{the entire plane}$

## Solution
\begin{align*}(x+y)^2&=x^2+y^2\\ x^2 + 2xy + y^2 &= x^2 + y^2\\ 2xy &= 0\end{align*} Either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ . The union of them is 2 lines, and thus the answer is $\mathrm{(C)}$ .
