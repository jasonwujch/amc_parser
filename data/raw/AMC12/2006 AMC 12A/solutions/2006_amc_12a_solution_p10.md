# 2006 AMC 12A Problem 10

## Problem

For how many real values of $x$ is $\sqrt{120-\sqrt{x}}$ an integer?

$\textbf{(A) } 3\qquad \textbf{(B) } 6\qquad \textbf{(C) } 9\qquad \textbf{(D) } 10\qquad \textbf{(E) } 11$ .

## Solution
For $\sqrt{120-\sqrt{x}}$ to be an integer, $120-\sqrt{x}$ must be a perfect square.
Since $\sqrt{x}$ can't be negative, $120-\sqrt{x} \leq 120$ .
The perfect squares that are less than or equal to $120$ are $\{0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100\}$ , so there are $11$ values for $120-\sqrt{x}$ .
Since every value of $120-\sqrt{x}$ gives one and only one possible value for $x$ , the number of values of $x$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }11}$ .
