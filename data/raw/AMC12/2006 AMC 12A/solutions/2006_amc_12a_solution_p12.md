## Problem

A number of linked rings, each $1$ cm thick, are hanging on a peg. The top ring has an outside diameter of $20$ cm. The outside diameter of each of the outer rings is $1$ cm less than that of the ring above it. The bottom ring has an outside diameter of $3$ cm. What is the distance, in cm, from the top of the top ring to the bottom of the bottom ring?

[asy] size(7cm); pathpen = linewidth(0.7); D(CR((0,0),10)); D(CR((0,0),9.5)); D(CR((0,-18.5),9.5)); D(CR((0,-18.5),9)); MP("$\vdots$",(0,-31),(0,0)); D(CR((0,-39),3)); D(CR((0,-39),2.5)); D(CR((0,-43.5),2.5)); D(CR((0,-43.5),2)); D(CR((0,-47),2)); D(CR((0,-47),1.5)); D(CR((0,-49.5),1.5)); D(CR((0,-49.5),1.0)); D((12,-10)--(12,10)); MP('20',(12,0),E); D((12,-51)--(12,-48)); MP('3',(12,-49.5),E);[/asy]

$\textbf{(A) } 171\qquad\textbf{(B) } 173\qquad\textbf{(C) } 182\qquad\textbf{(D) } 188\qquad\textbf{(E) } 210\qquad$

## Solution 1
The inside diameters of the rings are the positive integers from $1$ to $18$ . The total distance needed is the sum of these values plus $2$ for the top of the first ring and the bottom of the last ring. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series , the answer is $\frac{18 \cdot 19}{2} + 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }173}$ .

## Solution 2
Alternatively, the sum of the consecutive integers from 3 to 20 is $\frac{1}{2}(18)(3+20) = 207$ . However, the 17 intersections between the rings must be subtracted, and we also get $207 - 2(17) = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }173}$ .

## Solution 3 (Brute force)
We can just add all the numbers up. But, we have to account for the intersections, so the final expression is $3+\sum_{k=2}^{18} k$ , which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }173}$ . ~ shunyipanda
