# 2002 AMC 12B Problem 4

## Problem

Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $\frac 12 + \frac 13 + \frac 17 + \frac 1n$ is an integer. Which of the following statements is not true:

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 2\ \text{divides\ }n \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 3\ \text{divides\ }n \qquad\mathrm{(C)}$ $\ 6\ \text{divides\ }n \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 7\ \text{divides\ }n \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ n > 84$

## Solution 1
Since $\frac 12 + \frac 13 + \frac 17 = \frac {41}{42}$ , $0 < \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{41}{42} + \frac{1}{n}\right) < \frac {41}{42} + \frac 1n < \frac{41}{42} + \frac 11 < 2$
From which it follows that $\frac{41}{42} + \frac 1n = 1$ and $n = 42$ . The only answer choice that is not true is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ n>84}$ .

## Solution 2 (no limits)
Since $\frac 12 + \frac 13 + \frac 17 = \frac {41}{42}$ , it is very clear that $n=42$ makes the expression an integer*. Because $n$ is a positive integer, $\frac{1}{n}$ must be less than or equal to $1$ . Thus, the only integer the expression can take is $1$ , which means the only value for $n$ is $42$ . Thus $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ n>84}$

## Solution 2.1 (faster ending to solution 2)
Once you find $n=42$ , you can skip the rest of Solution 2 by noting that $n=42=2\times3\times7$ , which satisfies A, B, C, D, but not E. Thus $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ n>84}$ must be the answer by PoE (Process of Elimination).

## Solution 3(similiar to solution2)
Cross multiplying and adding the fraction we get the fraction to be equal to $\frac {41n + 42}{42n}$ , This value has to be an integer. This implies,
$42n|(41n+42)$ .
=> $42|(41n + 42)$
=> $n|(41n+42)$
from (1) and (2) we get that n=42. Comparing this with the options, we see that option E is the incorrect statement and hence E is the answer.
