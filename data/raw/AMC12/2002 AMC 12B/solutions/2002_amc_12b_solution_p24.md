# 2002 AMC 12B Problem 24

## Problem

A convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ with area $2002$ contains a point $P$ in its interior such that $PA = 24, PB = 32, PC = 28, PD = 45$ . Find the perimeter of $ABCD$ .

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 4\sqrt{2002} \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 2\sqrt{8465} \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 2$ $(48+\sqrt{2002}) \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 2\sqrt{8633} \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 4(36 + \sqrt{113})$

## Solution 1
We have \[[ABCD] = 2002 \le \frac 12 (AC \cdot BD)\] (This is true for any convex quadrilateral: split the quadrilateral along $AC$ and then using the triangle area formula to evaluate $[ACB]$ and $[ACD]$ ), with equality only if $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{BD}$ . By the triangle inequality ,
\begin{align*}AC &\le PA + PC = 52\\ BD &\le PB + PD = 77\end{align*}
with equality if $P$ lies on $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ respectively. Thus
\[2002 \le \frac{1}{2} AC \cdot BD \le \frac 12 \cdot 52 \cdot 77 = 2002\]
Since we have the equality case, $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{BD}$ at point $P$ , as shown below.
By the Pythagorean Theorem , \begin{align*} AB = \sqrt{PA^2 + PB^2} & = \sqrt{24^2 + 32^2} = 40\\ BC = \sqrt{PB^2 + PC^2} & = \sqrt{32^2 + 28^2} = 4\sqrt{113}\\ CD = \sqrt{PC^2 + PD^2} & = \sqrt{28^2 + 45^2} = 53\\ DA = \sqrt{PD^2 + PA^2} & = \sqrt{45^2 + 24^2} = 51 \end{align*}
The perimeter of $ABCD$ is $AB + BC + CD + DA = 4(36 + \sqrt{113}) \Rightarrow \mathrm{(E)}$ .

## Solution 2
Draw the diagram out. Notice the very peculiar sets of numbers $(24,32);(24,45);(28,45)$ ; these are simply multiples of the legs of well-known Pythagorean triples $(3,4,5);(8,15,17);(28,45,53)$ , pointing to signs of possible right angles. We can assume that $\angle APB=\angle BPC=\angle CPD=\angle DPA=90^\circ$ , so the area of the entire figure would be:
\[A=\frac{1}{2}\cdot(24+28)(45+32)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot52\cdot77=2002\]
Thus this is the correct case, so finding the side lengths of $ABCD$ by the Pythagorean Theorem yields $AB=40$ , $BC=4\sqrt{113}$ , $CD=53$ , $DA=51$ , so the perimeter is $40+4\sqrt{130}+53+51=144+4\sqrt{130}=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }4(36+\sqrt{113})}$ .
