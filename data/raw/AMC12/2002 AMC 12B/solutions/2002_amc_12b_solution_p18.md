## Problem

A point $P$ is randomly selected from the rectangular region with vertices $(0,0),(2,0),(2,1),(0,1)$ . What is the probability that $P$ is closer to the origin than it is to the point $(3,1)$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac 12 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac 23 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \frac 34 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \frac 45 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 1$

## Solution

## Solution 1
Assume that the point $P$ is randomly chosen within the rectangle with vertices $(0,0)$ , $(3,0)$ , $(3,1)$ , $(0,1)$ . In this case, the region for $P$ to be closer to the origin than to point $(3,1)$ occupies exactly $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area of the rectangle, or $1.5$ square units.
If $P$ is chosen within the square with vertices $(2,0)$ , $(3,0)$ , $(3,1)$ , $(2,1)$ which has area $1$ square unit, it is for sure closer to $(3,1)$ .
Now if $P$ can only be chosen within the rectangle with vertices $(0,0)$ , $(2,0)$ , $(2,1)$ , $(0,1)$ , then the square region is removed and the area for $P$ to be closer to $(3,1)$ is then decreased by $1$ square unit, left with only $0.5$ square unit.
Thus the probability that $P$ is closer to $(3.1)$ is $\frac{0.5}{2}=\frac{1}{4}$ and that of $P$ is closer to the origin is $1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$ . $\mathrm{(C)}$

## Solution 2 (slightly more calculation but easy:)
First, join points $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$ . This line $l 1$ has equation $y = \frac{1}{3}x$ .
Next, consider the perpendicular bisector $l 2$ of line $l 1$ , any point on the perpendicular bisector is equidistance from points $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$ .
If the point $P$ is chosen on the left of $l 2$ , the point is closer to the origin. $l 2$ will cut the rectangle region twice, dividing the region into two smaller trapezoids. The trapezoid on the left side is the area we want.
So, first, find the equation of $l 2$ , using the midpoint of $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$ , which is $(1.5,0.5)$ , the equation $y = -3x + 5$ can be easily derived. Substituting $y = 0$ and $y = 1$ to solve for $x$ . For the former, $x = \frac{5}{3}$ , for the latter, $x = \frac{4}{3}$ .
Thus, the area of the trapezoid we want is $\frac {(\frac{5}{3} + \frac{4}{3})\cdot1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$
Therefore, the probability the question asks equals to $\frac{\frac{3}{2}}{2} =\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{3}{4}}$
