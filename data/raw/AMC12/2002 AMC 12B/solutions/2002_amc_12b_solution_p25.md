# 2002 AMC 12B Problem 25

## Problem

Let $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 1$ , and let $R$ denote the set of points $(x,y)$ in the coordinate plane such that \[f(x) + f(y) \le 0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad f(x)-f(y) \le 0\] The area of $R$ is closest to

$\textbf{(A) } 21 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 22 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 23 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 24 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 25$

## Solution 1
The first condition gives us that \[x^2 + 6x + 1 + y^2 + 6y + 1 \le 0 \Longrightarrow (x+3)^2 + (y+3)^2 \le 16\]
which is a circle centered at $(-3,-3)$ with radius $4$ . The second condition gives us that
\[x^2 + 6x + 1 - y^2 - 6y - 1 \le 0 \Longrightarrow (x^2 - y^2) + 6(x-y) \le 0 \Longrightarrow (x-y)(x+y+6) \le 0\]
Thus either
\[x - y \ge 0,\quad x+y+6 \le 0\]
or
\[x - y \le 0,\quad x+y+6 \ge 0\]
Each of those lines passes through $(-3,-3)$ and has slope $\pm 1$ , as shown above. Therefore, the area of $R$ is half of the area of the circle, which is $\frac{1}{2} (\pi \cdot 4^2) = 8\pi \approx \boxed{\textbf{(E) }25}$ . ~SHEN KISLAY KAI

## Solution 2
Similar to Solution 1, we proceed to get the area of the circle satisfying $f(x)+f(y) \le 0$ , or $16 \pi$ .
Since $f(x)-f(y) \le 0 \implies f(x) \le f(y)$ , we have that by symmetry, if $(x,y)$ is in $R$ , then $(y,x)$ is not, and vice versa. Therefore, the shaded part of the circle above the line $y=x$ has the same area as the unshaded part below $y=x$ , and the unshaded part above $y=x$ has the same area as the shaded part below $y=x$ . This means that exactly half the circle is shaded, allowing us to divide by two to get $\frac{16 \pi }{2} = 8\pi \approx \boxed{\textbf{(E) }25}$ . ~samrocksnature + ddot1 +Shen kislay kai
### Note
The equation $\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 0 \hspace{1mm} \text{or} \hspace{1mm} \frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 0$ is the equation of a degenerate hyperbola.
