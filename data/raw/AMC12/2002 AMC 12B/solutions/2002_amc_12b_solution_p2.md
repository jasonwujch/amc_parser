## Problem

What is the value of $(3x - 2)(4x + 1) - (3x - 2)4x + 1$ when $x=4$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 0 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 1 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 10 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 11 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 12$

## Solution 1
By the distributive property,
\[(3x-2)[(4x+1)-4x] + 1 = 3x-2 + 1 = 3x-1 = 3(4) - 1 = \boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 11}\] .

## Solution 2
Inputting 4 into $x$ in the original equation,
\[[3(4)-2][4(4)+1]-[3(4)-2][4(4)]+1 = 170-160+1 = \boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 11}\]
