## Problem

Let $\triangle XOY$ be a right-angled triangle with $m\angle XOY = 90^{\circ}$ . Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of legs $OX$ and $OY$ , respectively. Given that $XN = 19$ and $YM = 22$ , find $XY$ .

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 24 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 26 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 28 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 30 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 32$

## Solution 1
Let $OM = x$ , $ON = y$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle XON, MOY$ respectively, \begin{align*} (2x)^2 + y^2 &= 19^2\\ x^2 + (2y)^2 &= 22^2\end{align*}
Summing these gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 = 845 \Longrightarrow x^2 + y^2 = 169$ .
By the Pythagorean Theorem again, we have
\[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = XY^2 \Longrightarrow XY = \sqrt{4(x^2 + y^2)} = \sqrt{4(169)} = \sqrt{676} = \boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 26}.\]
Alternatively, we could note that since we found $x^2 + y^2 = 169$ , segment $MN=13$ . Right triangles $\triangle MON$ and $\triangle XOY$ are similar by Leg-Leg with a ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$ , so $XY=2(MN)=\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 26}$ .

## Solution 2
Let $XO=x$ and $YO=y.$ Then, $XY=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.$
Since $XN=19$ and $YM=22,$ \[XN^2=19^2=x^2+(\dfrac{y}{2})^2)=\dfrac{x^2}{4}+y^2\] \[YM^2=22^2=(\dfrac{x}{2})^2+y^2=\dfrac{x^2}{4}+y^2.\]
Adding these up: \[19^2+22^2=\dfrac{4x^2+y^2}{4}+\dfrac{x^2+4y^2}{4}\] \[845=\dfrac{5x^2+5y^2}{4}\] \[3380=5x^2+5y^2\] \[676=x^2+y^2.\]
Then, we substitute: $XY=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{676}=\boxed{26}.$

## Solution 3 (Solution 1 but shorter)
Refer to the diagram in solution 1. $4x^2+y^2=361$ and $4y^2+x^2=484$ , so add them: $5x^2+5y^2=845$ and divide by 5: $x^2+y^2=169$ so $\dfrac{XY}{2}=\sqrt{169}=13$ and so $XY=26$ , or answer $\boxed{\text{(B)}}$ .

## Solution 4
Use the diagram in solution 1. Get $4x^2+y^2=361$ and $4y^2+x^2=484$ , and multiply the second equation by 4 to get $4x^2+16y^2=1936$ and then subtract the first from the second. Get $15y^2=1575$ and $y^2=105$ . Repeat for the other variable to get $15x^2=960$ and $x^2=64$ . Now XY is equal to the square root of four times these quantities, so $(105+64) \cdot 4=676$ , and $XY=\boxed{\text{(B)}\ 26}$ .

## Solution 5 (Quick and good for in-contest use)
Let $XM = MO = y$ , and $ON = NY = x$ . Now, we can write some equations. We have that \[(2y)^2+x^2 = 19^2 \Longrightarrow 4y^2 + x^2 = 361,\] and \[(2x)^2+y^2 = 22^2 \Longrightarrow 4x^2+y^2 = 484.\] Adding the $2$ equations up we get \[5x^2+5y^2 = 845.\] The hypotenuse of the triangle is equal to \[\sqrt{4x^2+4y^2},\] so that is what we want. In order to get \[4x^2+4y^2,\] we need to subtract $x^2+y^2$ from $5x^2+5y^2$ , and since $x^2+y^2 = \dfrac{1}{5}\left(5x^2+5y^2\right)$ , we have that \[4x^2+4y^2 = \dfrac{4}{5} \cdot 845 = 676.\] Therefore, the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{676} = \boxed{\text{(B)}\ 26}$ .
