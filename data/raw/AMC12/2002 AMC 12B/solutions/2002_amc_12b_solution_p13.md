## Problem

The sum of $18$ consecutive positive integers is a perfect square . The smallest possible value of this sum is

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 169 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 225 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 289 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 361 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 441$

## Solution 1
Let $a, a+1, \ldots, a + 17$ be the consecutive positive integers. Their sum, $18a + \frac{17(18)}{2} = 9(2a+17)$ , is a perfect square. Since $9$ is a perfect square, it follows that $2a + 17$ is a perfect square. The smallest possible such perfect square is $25$ when $a = 4$ , and the sum is $225 \Rightarrow \mathrm{(B)}$ .

## Solution 2
Notice that all five choices given are perfect squares.
Let $a$ be the smallest number, we have \[a+(a+1)+(a+2)+...+(a+17)=18a+\sum_{k=1}^{17}k=18a+153\]
Subtract $153$ from each of the choices and then check its divisibility by $18$ , we have $225$ as the smallest possible sum. $\mathrm {(B)}$

## Solution 1.1
the normal sequence can be described as $N^2+N$ divided by 2.
Since have 18 terms adding 18n will increase the consective sequence startering number by 1
$\frac{(N^2+N)}{2} +18n$
now subsitute 18 as N
we get $\frac{(18^2+18)}{2} = 171$
put $I^2$ which is integer square and plug in all our results $171 + 18n = I^2$
$18n = I^2-171 I^2-171 = 0 \pmod{18}$
subsitute the answer choices starting with B because 169 is less than 171 and results in a neagtive number
$225-177 = \pmod{18}$ $54 = \pmod{18}$
54 is divisble by 18 and is therefore the smallest number possible.
