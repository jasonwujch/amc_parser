## Problem

The product of three consecutive positive integers is $8$ times their sum. What is the sum of their squares ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 50 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 77 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 110 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 149 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 194$

## Solution
Let the three consecutive positive integers be $a-1$ , $a$ , and $a+1$ . Since the mean is $a$ , the sum of the integers is $3a$ . So $8$ times the sum is just $24a$ . With this, we now know that $a(a-1)(a+1)=24a\Rightarrow(a-1)(a+1)=24$ . $24=4\times6$ , so $a=5$ . Hence, the sum of the squares is $4^2+5^2+6^2=\boxed{\mathrm{ (B)}\ 77}$ .
