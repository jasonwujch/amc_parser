# 2003 AMC 12B Problem 1

## Problem

Which of the following is the same as

\[\frac{2-4+6-8+10-12+14}{3-6+9-12+15-18+21}?\]

$\text {(A) } -1 \qquad \text {(B) } -\frac{2}{3} \qquad \text {(C) } \frac{2}{3} \qquad \text {(D) } 1 \qquad \text {(E) } \frac{14}{3}$

## Solution 1
\[\frac{2-4+6-8+10-12+14}{3-6+9-12+15-18+21}=\frac{2+(-4+6)+(-8+10)+(-12+14)}{3+(-6+9)+(-12+15)+(-18+21)}=\frac{2\cdot4}{3\cdot4}=\text {(C) } \frac{2}{3}\]

## Solution 2
Each term in the numerator is $\text {(C) } \frac{2}{3}$ of a corresponding term in the denominator, so this must be the quotient.
