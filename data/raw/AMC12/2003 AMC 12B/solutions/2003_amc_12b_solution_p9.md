# 2003 AMC 12B Problem 9

## Problem

Let $f$ be a linear function for which $f(6) - f(2) = 12.$ What is $f(12) - f(2)?$

$\text {(A) } 12 \qquad \text {(B) } 18 \qquad \text {(C) } 24 \qquad \text {(D) } 30 \qquad \text {(E) } 36$

## Solution 1
Since $f$ is a linear function with slope $m$ ,
\[m = \frac{f(6) - f(2)}{\Delta x} = \frac{12}{6 - 2} = 3\]
\[f(12) - f(2) = m \Delta x = 3(12 - 2) = 30 \Rightarrow \text (D)\]

## Solution 2
Since $f$ is linear, we can easily guess and check to confirm that $f(x)=3x$ . Indeed, $f(6)-f(2)=3(6-2)=12$ . So, we have $f(12)-f(2)=3(12-2)=30 \Rightarrow \text (D).$

## Solution 3
Since $f$ is linear, $f(x)$ = $ax+b$ , we can use a system of equations to solve for $f$ .
\[f(6) = a(6) + b\] \[f(2) = a(2) + b\]
Now subtracting: \[f(6) - f(2) = 4a\] \[12 = 4a \Rightarrow a = 3\]
Analyze the target equation to get: \[f(12) - f(2) = 3(12) + b - (3(2) + b)\] (NOTE: $b$ cancels) \[= 30 \Rightarrow \text(D)\]
