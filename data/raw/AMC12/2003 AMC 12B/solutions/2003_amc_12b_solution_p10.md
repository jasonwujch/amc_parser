# 2003 AMC 12B Problem 10

## Problem

Several figures can be made by attaching two equilateral triangles to the regular pentagon ABCDE in two of the five positions shown. How many non-congruent figures can be constructed in this way?

$\text {(A) } 1 \qquad \text {(B) } 2 \qquad \text {(C) } 3 \qquad \text {(D) } 4 \qquad \text {(E) } 5$

## Solution 1
Place the first triangle. Now, we can place the second triangle either adjacent to the first, or with one side between them, for a total of $\boxed{\text{(B) }2}$

## Solution 2
Take ${5 \choose 2}$ to realize there are 10 ways to choose 2 different triangles. Then divide by 5 for each vertex of a pentagon to get $\boxed{\text{(B) }2}$
