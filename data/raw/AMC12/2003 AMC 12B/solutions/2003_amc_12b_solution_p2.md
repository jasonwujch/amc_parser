## Problem

Al gets the disease algebritis and must take one green pill and one pink pill each day for two weeks. A green pill costs $\$ $1$ more than a pink pill, and Al's pills cost a total of $\textdollar 546$ for the two weeks. How much does one green pill cost?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \textdollar 7 \qquad\textbf{(B) }\textdollar 14 \qquad\textbf{(C) }\textdollar 19\qquad\textbf{(D) }\textdollar 20\qquad\textbf{(E) }\textdollar 39$

## Solution
Because there are $14$ days in two weeks, Al spends $546/14 = 39$ dollars per day for the cost of a green pill and a pink pill. If the green pill costs $x$ dollars and the pink pill $x-1$ dollars, the sum of the two costs $2x-1$ should equal $39$ dollars. Then the cost of the green pill $x$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\textdollar 20}$ .
