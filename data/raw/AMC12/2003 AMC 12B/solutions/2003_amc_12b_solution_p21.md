# 2003 AMC 12B Problem 21

## Problem

An object moves $8$ cm in a straight line from $A$ to $B$ , turns at an angle $\alpha$ , measured in radians and chosen at random from the interval $(0,\pi)$ , and moves $5$ cm in a straight line to $C$ . What is the probability that $AC < 7$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{1}{6} \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{1}{5} \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \frac{1}{4} \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \frac{1}{3} \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \frac{1}{2}$

## Solution 1 (Trigonometry)
By the Law of Cosines , \begin{align*} AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 AB \cdot BC \cos \alpha = 89 - 80 \cos \alpha = AC^2 &< 49\\ \cos \alpha &> \frac 12\\ \end{align*}
It follows that $0 < \alpha < \frac {\pi}3$ , and the probability is $\frac{\pi/3}{\pi} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac13 }$ .

## Solution 2 (Analytic Geometry)
$WLOG$ , let the object turn clockwise.
Let $B = (0, 0)$ , $A = (0, -8)$ .
Note that the possible points of $C$ create a semi-circle of radius $5$ and center $B$ . The area where $AC < 7$ is enclosed by a circle of radius $7$ and center $A$ . The probability that $AC < 7$ is $\frac{\angle ABO}{180 ^\circ}$ .
The function of $\odot B$ is $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ , the function of $\odot A$ is $x^2 + (y+8)^2 = 49$ .
$O$ is the point that satisfies the system of equations: $\begin{cases} x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\ x^2 + (y+8)^2 = 49 \end{cases}$
$x^2 + (y+8)^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 49 - 25$ , $64 + 16y =24$ , $y = - \frac52$ , $x = \frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{2}$ , $O = (\frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{2}, - \frac52)$
Note that $\triangle BDO$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle, as $BO = 5$ , $BD = \frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{2}$ , $DO = \frac52$ . As a result $\angle CBO = 30 ^\circ$ , $\angle ABO = 60 ^\circ$ .
Therefore the probability that $AC < 7$ is $\frac{\angle ABO}{180 ^\circ} = \frac{60 ^\circ}{180 ^\circ} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac13 }$

## Solution 3 (Geometric Probability)
Setting $A = (0,0)$ we get that $B = (8,0)$ , after assuming segment AB to be straight in the x-direction relative to our coordinate system (in other words, due to symmetrically we can set $x = 8$ for point B). This gives $C = (8 + 5cos(\alpha), 5sin(\alpha))$ . Using the distance formula we get $sqrt((8 + 5cos(\alpha))^2 + (5sin(\alpha))^2) < 7$ . After algebra, this simplifies to $cos(\alpha) < -\frac{1}{2}$ . After evaluating the constraints of the problem, we land on option (D).

## Solution 4 (Triangle Inequality)
Note that we can treat $\text{ABC}$ as a triangle with side lengths $5$ , $8$ and $AC=x.$ Because $0$ and $\pi$ are not part of the interval of valid $\alpha$ values, $\triangle \text{ABC}$ is a non-degenerate triangle. Then, by the Triangle Inequality, $5+8>x,$ $5+x>8,$ and $8+x>5.$ These reduce to $x<13,$ $x>3,$ and $x>-3.$ Thus, the possible values of x are $3<x<13,$ or $x=\text{[}4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12\text{]}.$ Of these $9$ possible $x,$ $3$ of them are less than $7,$ so the probability that $x<7$ is $\frac39=\frac13=\boxed{\text{(D)}}.$
