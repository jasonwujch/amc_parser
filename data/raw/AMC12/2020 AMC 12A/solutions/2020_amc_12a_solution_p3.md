# 2020 AMC 12A Problem 3

## Problem

A driver travels for $2$ hours at $60$ miles per hour, during which her car gets $30$ miles per gallon of gasoline. She is paid $\$0.50$ per mile, and her only expense is gasoline at $\$2.00$ per gallon. What is her net rate of pay, in dollars per hour, after this expense?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 22\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 24\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 25\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 26$

## Solution 1
Since the driver travels $60$ miles per hour and each hour she uses $2$ gallons of gasoline, she spends $\$4$ per hour on gas. If she gets $\$0.50$ per mile, then she gets $\$30$ per hour of driving. Subtracting the gas cost, her net rate of money earned per hour is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 26}$ . ~mathsmiley

## Solution 2 (longer)
The driver is driving for $2$ hours at $60$ miles per hour, she drives $120$ miles. Therefore, she uses $\frac{120}{30}=4$ gallons of gasoline. So, total she has $\$0.50\cdot120-\$2.00\cdot4=\$60-\$8=\$52$ . So, her rate is $\frac{52}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 26}$ . ~sosiaops
