# 2020 AMC 12A Problem 2

## Problem

The acronym AMC is shown in the rectangular grid below with grid lines spaced $1$ unit apart. In units, what is the sum of the lengths of the line segments that form the acronym AMC $?$

[asy] import olympiad; unitsize(25); for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < 9; ++j) { pair A = (j,i); } } for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < 9; ++j) { if (j != 8) { draw((j,i)--(j+1,i), dashed); } if (i != 2) { draw((j,i)--(j,i+1), dashed); } } } draw((0,0)--(2,2),linewidth(2)); draw((2,0)--(2,2),linewidth(2)); draw((1,1)--(2,1),linewidth(2)); draw((3,0)--(3,2),linewidth(2)); draw((5,0)--(5,2),linewidth(2)); draw((4,1)--(3,2),linewidth(2)); draw((4,1)--(5,2),linewidth(2)); draw((6,0)--(8,0),linewidth(2)); draw((6,2)--(8,2),linewidth(2)); draw((6,0)--(6,2),linewidth(2)); [/asy]

$\textbf{(A) } 17 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 15 + 2\sqrt{2} \qquad \textbf{(C) } 13 + 4\sqrt{2} \qquad \textbf{(D) } 11 + 6\sqrt{2} \qquad \textbf{(E) } 21$

## Solution 1
Each of the straight line segments have length $1$ and each of the slanted line segments have length $\sqrt{2}$ (this can be deducted using $45-45-90$ , pythag, trig, or just sense)
There area a total of $13$ straight lines segments and $4$ slanted line segments. The sum is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 13 + 4\sqrt{2}}$

## Solution 2
Either count the straight or diagonals and deduce from the answers that the only answer possible is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 13 + 4\sqrt{2}}$ .
