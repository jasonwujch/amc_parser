## Problem

In the complex plane, let $A$ be the set of solutions to $z^{3}-8=0$ and let $B$ be the set of solutions to $z^{3}-8z^{2}-8z+64=0.$ What is the greatest distance between a point of $A$ and a point of $B?$

$\textbf{(A) } 2\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(B) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 2\sqrt{21} \qquad \textbf{(E) } 9+\sqrt{3}$

## Solution 1
We solve each equation separately:
1. We solve $z^{3}-8=0$ by De Moivre's Theorem. Let where is the magnitude of such that and is the argument of such that We have from which so so or The set of solutions to $z^{3}-8=0$ is $\boldsymbol{A=\left\{2,-1+\sqrt{3}i,-1-\sqrt{3}i\right\}}.$ In the complex plane, the solutions form the vertices of an equilateral triangle whose circumcircle has center $0$ and radius $2.$
1. We solve $z^{3}-8z^{2}-8z+64=0$ by factoring by grouping.
Let $z=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)=r\operatorname{cis}\theta,$ where $r$ is the magnitude of $z$ such that $r\geq0,$ and $\theta$ is the argument of $z$ such that $0\leq\theta<2\pi.$
We have \[z^3=r^3\operatorname{cis}(3\theta)=8(1),\] from which
- $r^3=8,$ so $r=2.$
- $\begin{cases} \begin{aligned} \cos(3\theta) &= 1 \\ \sin(3\theta) &= 0 \end{aligned}, \end{cases}$ so $3\theta=0,2\pi,4\pi,$ or $\theta=0,\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{4\pi}{3}.$
We have \begin{align*} z^2(z-8)-8(z-8)&=0 \\ \bigl(z^2-8\bigr)(z-8)&=0. \end{align*} The set of solutions to $z^{3}-8z^{2}-8z+64=0$ is $\boldsymbol{B=\left\{2\sqrt{2},-2\sqrt{2},8\right\}}.$
In the graph below, the points in set $A$ are shown in red, and the points in set $B$ are shown in blue. The greatest distance between a point of $A$ and a point of $B$ is the distance between $-1\pm\sqrt{3}i$ to $8,$ as shown in the dashed line segments.

## Solution 2
Alternatively, we can solve $z^{3}-8=0$ by the difference of cubes: \[(z-2)\left(z^2+2z+4\right)=0.\]
- If $z-2=0,$ then $z=2.$
- If $z^2+2z+4=0,$ then $z=-1\pm\sqrt{3}i$ by either completing the square or the quadratic formula.
The set of solutions to $z^{3}-8=0$ is $A=\left\{2,-1+\sqrt{3}i,-1-\sqrt{3}i\right\}.$
Following the rest of Solution 1 gives the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 2\sqrt{21}}.$
