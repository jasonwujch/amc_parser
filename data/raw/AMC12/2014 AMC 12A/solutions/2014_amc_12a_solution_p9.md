## Problem

Five positive consecutive integers starting with $a$ have average $b$ . What is the average of $5$ consecutive integers that start with $b$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ a+3\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ a+4\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ a+5\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ a+6\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ a+7$

## Solution 1
Let $a=1$ . Our list is $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ with an average of $15\div 5=3$ . Our next set starting with $3$ is $\{3,4,5,6,7\}$ . Our average is $25\div 5=5$ .
Therefore, we notice that $5=1+4$ which means that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ a+4}$ .

## Solution 2
We are given that \[b=\frac{a+a+1+a+2+a+3+a+4}{5}\] \[\implies b =a+2\]
We are asked to find the average of the 5 consecutive integers starting from $b$ in terms of $a$ . By substitution, this is \[\frac{a+2+a+3+a+4+a+5+a+6}5=a+4\]
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ a+4}$

## Solution 3 (fast)
We know from experience (or logical reasoning) that the average of $5$ consecutive numbers is the $3^\text{rd}$ one or the $1^\text{st} + 2$ . With the logic, we find that $b=a+2$ . Therefore, $b+2=(a+2)+2=\boxed{a+4}$ .

## Solution 4
The list of numbers is $\left\{a,\ a+1,\ b,\ a+3,\ a+4\right\}$ so $b=a+2$ . The new list is $\left\{a+2,\ a+3,\ a+4,\ a+5,\ a+6\right\}$ and the average is $a+4 \Longrightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(B) } a+4}$ .
