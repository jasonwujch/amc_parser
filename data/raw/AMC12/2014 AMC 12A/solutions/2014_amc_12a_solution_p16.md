# 2014 AMC 12A Problem 16

## Problem

The product $(8)(888\dots8)$ , where the second factor has $k$ digits, is an integer whose digits have a sum of $1000$ . What is $k$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 901\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 911\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 919\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 991\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 999$

## Solution 1
We can list the first few numbers in the form $8 \cdot (8....8)$
(Hard problem to do without the multiplication, but you can see the pattern early on)
$8 \cdot 8 = 64$
$8 \cdot 88 = 704$
$8 \cdot 888 = 7104$
$8 \cdot 8888 = 71104$
$8 \cdot 88888 = 711104$
By now it's clear that the numbers will be in the form $7$ , $k-2$ $1$ 's, and $04$ . We want to make the numbers sum to 1000, so $7+4+(k-2) = 1000$ . Solving, we get $k = 991$ , meaning the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 991}$
Another way to proceed is that we know the difference between the sum of the digits of each product and $k$ is always $9$ , so we just do $1000-9=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 991}$ .

## Proof of Solution 1
Since this solution won't fly on a proof-based competition, here's a proof that it's valid:
We will call $x_k=8(888\dots8)$ with exactly $k$ $8$ s. We then rewrite this more formally, as:
\[x_k=8\biggr(\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}8(10)^n\biggr)\] \[=64\biggr(\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}(10)^n\biggr)\] \[=64\frac{10^{k}-1}{9}\]
Then, finding a recursive formula, we get:
\[x_{k+1}=64\times 10^{k}+x_k\]
We will now use induction, Our base case will be $k=2$ . It's easy to see that this becomes $x_2=704$ . Then, the $k+1$ case: let $x_k=7111\dots104$ with $k-2$ $1$ s. Then $x_{k+1}=64000\dots000+7111\dots104$ . Adding these numbers, we get $x_{k+1}=71111\dots104$ .
Summing these digits, we have $4+7+(k-2)=1000$ , giving us $k=991$ .

## Solution 2 (Educated Guessing if you have no time)
We first note that $125 \cdot 8 = 1000$ and so we assume there are $125$ 8s.
Then we note that it is asking for the second factor, so we subtract $1$ (the original $8$ in the first factor).
Now we have $125-1=124.$ The second factor is obviously a multiple of $124$ .
Listing the first few, we have $124, 248, 372, 496, 620, 744, 868, 992, 1116, 1240, ...$
We notice that the 4th answer choice is 1 less than a 992(a multiple of 124.)
Thus we make an educated guess that it is somehow less by 1, so we get $\fbox{(D)}$ . ~mathboy282
### Note (Must Read)
We were just lucky; this method is NOT reliable. Please note that this probably will not work for other problems; it is just a lucky coincidence.

## Solution 3
You can write the expression as 8(8*10^k + 8*10^k-1...)
This equals 64*10^k + 64*10^k-1...so if we add an example we see something.
6400000000+
0640000000+
0064000000+
0006400000+
0000640000+
0000064000+
0000006400+
0000000640+
0000000064=
7111111104
You see that is just 7 - M 1s- 04
There have to be 1000 - 7 - 4 = 989 1s.
When you divide 7111... by 8, the answer, since 7 < 8, is 1 digit less.
So we get 992 - 1 = 991, which is $\fbox{(D)}$ . ~vedantinity
