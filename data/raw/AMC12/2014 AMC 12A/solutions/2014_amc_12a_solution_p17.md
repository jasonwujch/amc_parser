## Problem

A $4\times 4\times h$ rectangular box contains a sphere of radius $2$ and eight smaller spheres of radius $1$ . The smaller spheres are each tangent to three sides of the box, and the larger sphere is tangent to each of the smaller spheres. What is $h$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }2+2\sqrt 7\qquad \textbf{(B) }3+2\sqrt 5\qquad \textbf{(C) }4+2\sqrt 7\qquad \textbf{(D) }4\sqrt 5\qquad \textbf{(E) }4\sqrt 7\qquad$

## Solution 1 (Light Coordinate Geometry)
Let one of the corners be $(0, 0, 0)$ . We can orient the box such that the center of the small sphere closest to the corner is $(1,1,1)$ , and the center of the large sphere is $(2, 2, h/2)$ .
Since the two spheres are tangent, the distance between their centers is $1+2 = 3$ , so $\sqrt{(2-1)^2+(2-1)^2+(h/2-1)^2} = 3$ . Solving, $h=2 + 2\sqrt{7}=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$

## Solution 2
Let $A$ be the point in the same plane as the centers of the top spheres equidistant from said centers. Let $B$ be the analogous point for the bottom spheres, and let $C$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ and the center of the large sphere. Let $D$ and $E$ be the points at which line $AB$ intersects the top of the box and the bottom, respectively.
Let $O$ be the center of any of the top spheres (you choose!). We have $AO=1\cdot\sqrt{2}$ , and $CO=3$ , so $AC=\sqrt{3^2-\left(\sqrt2\right)^2}=\sqrt{7}$ . Similarly, $BC=\sqrt{7}$ . $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BE}$ are clearly equal to the radius of the small spheres, $1$ . Thus the total height is $AD+AC+BC+BE=2+2\sqrt7$ , or $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$ .

## Solution 3
Let $A$ be the center of the large sphere and $C$ be the center of any small sphere. Let $D$ be a vertex of the rectangular prism closest to point $C$ . Let $F$ be the point on the edge of the prism such that $\overline{DF}$ and $\overline{AF}$ are perpendicular. Let points $B$ and point $E$ lie on $\overline{AF}$ and $\overline{DF}$ respectively such that $\overline{CE}$ and $\overline{CB}$ are perpendicular at $C$ .
$AC$ is the radii of the spheres, so $AC=2+1=3$ . $CE$ is the shortest length between the center of a small sphere and the edge of the prism, so $CE=\sqrt{2}$ . Similarly, $AF=2\sqrt{2}$ . Since $CEFB$ is a rectangle, $BF=CE=\sqrt{2}$ . Since $AF=2\sqrt{2}$ , $AB=AF - BF = \sqrt{2}$ . Then, $BC=\sqrt{3^2-\left(\sqrt2\right)^2}=\sqrt{7}=EF$ . $DE$ is the length from $C$ to the top of the prism or $1$ . Thus, $DF=DE+EF=1+\sqrt{7}$ . The prism is symmetrical, so $h=2DF=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$

## Solution 4
Take a cross section and you will see that h is made up of the two radii of the circles plus some radical expression. The only choice satisfying this condition is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$ .
