## Problem

A five-digit palindrome is a positive integer with respective digits $abcba$ , where $a$ is non-zero. Let $S$ be the sum of all five-digit palindromes. What is the sum of the digits of $S$ ?

$\textbf{(A) }9\qquad \textbf{(B) }18\qquad \textbf{(C) }27\qquad \textbf{(D) }36\qquad \textbf{(E) }45\qquad$

## Solution 1
For each digit $a=1,2,\ldots,9$ there are $10\cdot10$ (ways of choosing $b$ and $c$ ) palindromes. So the $a$ s contribute $(1+2+\cdots+9)(100)(10^4+1)$ to the sum. For each digit $b=0,1,2,\ldots,9$ there are $9\cdot10$ (since $a \neq 0$ ) palindromes. So the $b$ s contribute $(0+1+2+\cdots+9)(90)(10^3+10)$ to the sum. Similarly, for each $c=0,1,2,\ldots,9$ there are $9\cdot10$ palindromes, so the $c$ contributes $(0+1+2+\cdots+9)(90)(10^2)$ to the sum.
It just so happens that \[(1+2+\cdots+9)(100)(10^4+1)+(1+2+\cdots+9)(90)(10^3+10)+(1+2+\cdots+9)(90)(10^2)=49500000\] so the sum of the digits of the sum is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\; 18}$ .

## Solution 2
Notice that $10001+ 99999 = 110000.$ In fact, ordering the palindromes in ascending order, we find that the sum of the nth palindrome and the nth to last palindrome is $110000.$ We have $9\cdot 10\cdot 10$ palindromes, or $450$ pairs of palindromes summing to $110000.$ Performing the multiplication gives $49500000$ , so the sum $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\; 18}$ .

## Solution 3
As shown above, there are a total of $900$ five-digit palindromes. We can calculate their sum by finding the expected value of a randomly selected palindrome satisfying the conditions given, then multiplying it by $900$ to get our sum. The expected value for the ten-thousands and the units digit is $\frac{1+2+3+\cdots+9}{9}=5$ , and the expected value for the thousands, hundreds, and tens digit is $\frac{0+1+2+\cdots+9}{10}=4.5$ . Therefore our expected value is $5\times10^4+4.5\times10^3+4.5\times10^2+4.5\times10^1+5\times10^0=55,\!000$ . Since the question asks for the sum of the digits of the resulting sum, we do not need to keep the trailing zeros of either $55,\!000$ or $900$ . Thus we only need to calculate $55\times9=495$ , and the desired sum is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }18}$ .

## Solution 4 (Variation of #2)
First, allow $a$ to be zero, and then subtract by how much we overcount. We'll also sum each palindrome with its $\textit{complement}$ . If $\overline{abcba}$ (the line means a, b, and c are digits and $abcba\ne a\cdot b\cdot c\cdot b\cdot a$ ) is a palindrome, then its complement is $\overline{defed}$ where $d=9-a$ , $e=9-b$ , $f=9-c$ . Notice how every palindrome has a unique compliment, and that the sum of a palindrome and its complement is $99999$ . Therefore, the sum of our palindromes is $99999\times (10^3/2)$ . (There are $10^3/2$ pairs.)
However, we have overcounted, as something like $05350$ $\textit{isn't}$ a palindrome by the problem's definition, but we've still included it. So we must subtract the sum of numbers in the form $\overline{0nmn0}$ . By the same argument as before, these sum to $9990\times (10^2/2)$ . Therefore, the sum that the problem asks for is:
\[500\times99999-50\times 9990\] \[=500\times99999-500\times 999\] \[=500(99999-999)\] \[=500\times 99000\]
Since all we care about is the sum of the digits, we can drop the $0$ 's.
\[5\times99\] \[=5\times(100-1)\] \[=495\]
And finally, $4+9+5=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}18}$
