## Problem

At the theater children get in for half price. The price for $5$ adult tickets and $4$ child tickets is $\$24.50$ . How much would $8$ adult tickets and $6$ child tickets cost?

$\textbf{(A) }\$35\qquad \textbf{(B) }\$38.50\qquad \textbf{(C) }\$40\qquad \textbf{(D) }\$42\qquad \textbf{(E) }\$42.50$

## Solution
Suppose $x$ is the price of an adult ticket. The price of a child ticket would be $\frac{x}{2}$ .
\begin{eqnarray*} 5x + 4(x/2) = 7x &=& 24.50\\ x &=& 3.50\\ \end{eqnarray*}
Plug in for 8 adult tickets and 6 child tickets.
\begin{eqnarray*} 8x + 6(x/2) &=& 8(3.50) + 3(3.50)\\ &=&\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \ 38.50}\\ \end{eqnarray*}
