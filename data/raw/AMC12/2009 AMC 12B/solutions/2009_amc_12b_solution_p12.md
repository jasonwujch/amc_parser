## Problem

The fifth and eighth terms of a geometric sequence of real numbers are $7!$ and $8!$ respectively. What is the first term?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 60\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 75\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 120\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 225\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 315$

## Solution
Let the $n$ th term of the series be $ar^{n-1}$ . Because \[\frac {8!}{7!} = \frac {ar^7}{ar^4} = r^3 = 8,\] it follows that $r = 2$ and the first term is $a = \frac {7!}{r^4} = \frac {7!}{16} = \boxed{315}$ . The answer is $\mathrm{(E)}$ .
