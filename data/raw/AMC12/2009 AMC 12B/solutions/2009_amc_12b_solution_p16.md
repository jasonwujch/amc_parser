## Problem

Trapezoid $ABCD$ has $AD||BC$ , $BD = 1$ , $\angle DBA = 23^{\circ}$ , and $\angle BDC = 46^{\circ}$ . The ratio $BC: AD$ is $9: 5$ . What is $CD$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac 79\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ \frac 45\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ \frac {13}{15}\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ \frac 89\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ \frac {14}{15}$

## Solutions

## Solution 1
Extend $\overline {AB}$ and $\overline {DC}$ to meet at $E$ . Then
\begin{align*} \angle BED &= 180^{\circ} - \angle EDB - \angle DBE\\ &= 180^{\circ} - 134^{\circ} -23^{\circ} = 23^{\circ}. \end{align*}
Thus $\triangle BDE$ is isosceles with $DE = BD$ . Because $\overline {AD} \parallel \overline {BC}$ , it follows that the triangles $BCE$ and $ADE$ are similar. Therefore \[\frac 95 = \frac {BC}{AD} = \frac {CD + DE}{DE} = \frac {CD}{BD} + 1 = CD + 1,\] so $CD = \boxed{\frac 45}.$
