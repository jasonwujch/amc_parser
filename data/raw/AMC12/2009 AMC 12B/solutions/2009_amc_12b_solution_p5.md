# 2009 AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

Kiana has two older twin brothers. The product of their three ages is 128. What is the sum of their three ages?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 10\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 12\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 16\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 18\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 24$

## Solution
The age of each person is a factor of $128 = 2^7$ . So the twins could be $2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8$ years of age and, consequently Kiana could be $128$ , $32$ , $8$ , or $2$ years old, respectively. Because Kiana is younger than her brothers, she must be $2$ years old. So the sum of their ages is $2 + 8 + 8 = \boxed{18}$ . The answer is $\mathrm{(D)}$ .
