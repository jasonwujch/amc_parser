## Problem

In a certain year the price of gasoline rose by $20\%$ during January, fell by $20\%$ during February, rose by $25\%$ during March, and fell by $x\%$ during April. The price of gasoline at the end of April was the same as it had been at the beginning of January. To the nearest integer, what is $x$

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 12\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 17\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 20\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 25\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 35$

## Solution
Let $p$ be the price at the beginning of January. The price at the end of March was $(1.2)(0.8)(1.25)p = 1.2p.$ Because the price at the end of April was $p$ , the price decreased by $0.2p$ during April, and the percent decrease was \[x = 100 \cdot \frac{0.2p}{1.2p} = \frac {100}{6} \approx 16.7.\] So to the nearest integer $x$ is $\boxed{17}$ . The answer is $\mathrm{(B)}$ .

## Solution 2
Without loss of generality, we can assume the price at the beginning of January was $\$100$ .
When it rose by $20\%$ , it became $\$120$ , when it fell by $20\%$ , it became $\$96$ , and when it rose by $25\%$ , it became $\$120$ again.
In order for the price at the end of April to be the same as it was at the beginning of January ( $\$100$ ), the price must decrease by $\$20$ .
20 is $\frac{1}{6}th$ of 120, and $\frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167 \approx 17\%$ So to the nearest integer, $x = 17$ and the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 17}$ . ~azc1027
