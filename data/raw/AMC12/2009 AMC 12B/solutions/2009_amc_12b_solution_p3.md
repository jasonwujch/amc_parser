## Problem

Twenty percent less than 60 is one-third more than what number?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 16\qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 30\qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 32\qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 36\qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 48$

## Solution
Twenty percent less than 60 is $\frac 45 \cdot 60 = 48$ . One-third more than a number n is $\frac 43n$ . Therefore $\frac 43n = 48$ and the number is $\boxed {36}$ . The answer is $\mathrm{(D)}$ .
