# 2013 AMC 12B Problem 2

## Problem

Mr. Green measures his rectangular garden by walking two of the sides and finds that it is $15$ steps by $20$ steps. Each of Mr. Green's steps is $2$ feet long. Mr. Green expects a half a pound of potatoes per square foot from his garden. How many pounds of potatoes does Mr. Green expect from his garden?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 600 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 800 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 1000 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 1200 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 1400$

## Solution
Since each step is $2$ feet, his garden is $30$ by $40$ feet. Thus, the area of $30(40) = 1200$ square feet. Since he is expecting $\frac{1}{2}$ of a pound per square foot, the total amount of potatoes expected is $1200 \times \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }600}$
