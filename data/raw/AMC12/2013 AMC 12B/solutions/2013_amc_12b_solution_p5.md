## Problem

The average age of $33$ fifth-graders is $11$ . The average age of $55$ of their parents is $33$ . What is the average age of all of these parents and fifth-graders?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 22 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 23.25 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 24.75 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 26.25 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 28$

## Solution
The sum of the ages of the fifth graders is $33 * 11$ , while the sum of the ages of the parents is $55 * 33$ . Therefore, the total sum of all their ages must be $2178$ , and given $33 + 55 = 88$ people in total, their average age is $\frac{2178}{88} = \frac{99}{4} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 24.75}$ .
