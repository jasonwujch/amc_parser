## Problem

Ray's car averages $40$ miles per gallon of gasoline, and Tom's car averages $10$ miles per gallon of gasoline. Ray and Tom each drive the same number of miles. What is the cars' combined rate of miles per gallon of gasoline? $\textbf{(A)}\ 10 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 16 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 25 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 30 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 40$

## Solution 1
Let Ray and Tom drive 40 miles. Ray's car would require $\frac{40}{40}=1$ gallon of gas and Tom's car would require $\frac{40}{10}=4$ gallons of gas. They would have driven a total of $40+40=80$ miles, on $1+4=5$ gallons of gas, for a combined rate of $\frac{80}{5}=$ $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }16}$

## Solution 2
Taking the harmonic mean of the two rates, we get \[\left(\frac{40^{-1} + 10^{-1}}{2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{40}+\frac{1}{10}} = \frac{2}{\frac{5}{40}} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{8}} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }16}.\]

## Solution 3
Let the number of miles that Ray and Tom each drive be denoted by $m$ . Thus the number of gallons Ray's car uses can be represented by $\frac{m}{40}$ and the number of gallons that Tom's car uses can likewise be expressed as $\frac{m}{10}$ . Thus the total amount of gallons used by both cars can be expressed as $\frac{m}{40} + \frac{m}{10} = \frac{m}{8}$ . The total distance that both drive is equal to $2m$ so the total miles per gallon can be expressed as $\frac{2m}{\frac{m}{8}} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }16}$
