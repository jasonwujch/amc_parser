## Solution 1
Since $\angle{AFB}=\angle{ADB}=90^{\circ}$ , quadrilateral $ABDF$ is cyclic. It follows that $\angle{ADE}=\angle{ABF}$ , so $\triangle ABF \sim \triangle ADE$ are similar. In addition, $\triangle ADE \sim \triangle ACD$ . We can easily find $AD=12$ , $BD = 5$ , and $DC=9$ using Pythagorean triples.
So, the ratio of the longer leg to the hypotenuse of all three similar triangles is $\tfrac{12}{15} = \tfrac{4}{5}$ , and the ratio of the shorter leg to the hypotenuse is $\tfrac{9}{15} = \tfrac{3}{5}$ . It follows that $AF=(\tfrac{4}{5}\cdot 13), BF=(\tfrac{3}{5}\cdot 13)$ .
Let $x=DF$ . By Ptolemy's Theorem , we have \[13x+\left(5\cdot 13\cdot \frac{4}{5}\right)= 12\cdot 13\cdot \frac{3}{5} \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad 13x+52=93.6.\] Dividing by $13$ we get $x+4=7.2\implies x=\frac{16}{5}$ so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }21}$ .

## Solution 2
From solution 1, we know that $AD = 12$ and $DC = 9$ . Since $\triangle ADC \sim \triangle DEC$ , we can figure out that $DE = \frac{36}{5}$ . We also know what $AC$ is so we can figure what $AE$ is: $AE = 15 - \frac{27}{5} = \frac{48}{5}$ . Quadrilateral $ABDF$ is cyclic, implying that $\angle{B} + \angle{DFA}$ = 180°. Therefore, $\angle{B} = 180 - \angle{DFA} = \angle{EFA}$ , and triangles $\triangle AEF \sim \triangle ADB$ . Solving the resulting proportion gives $EF = 4$ . Therefore, $DF = ED - EF = \frac{16}{5}$ . $m + n = 16 + 5 = 21$ and our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 21}$ .
$\triangle ADC \sim \triangle DEC$ because of $AA \sim$ . $\angle{ADC} = \angle{DEC} = 90°$ . Lets say $\angle{ADE} = x$ . So $\angle{EDC} = 90 - x$ and $\angle{DEC} = 180 - 90 - (90 - x) = x$ so $\angle{ADE} = \angle{DEC}$

## Solution 3
Let $\angle{ADF} = \theta,$ and $DF = x.$ Noting that $AD$ is the altitude from $A$ to $BC,$ $AD=12,$ $BD = 5,$ and $DC = 9.$ Notice that since $DE$ is perpendicular to $AC$ , $\triangle{ADC}$ is similar to $\triangle{AEC}.$ Therefore since $\triangle{ADC}$ is a $3$ - $4$ - $5$ triangle, $\cos{\theta}=\frac{3}{5}.$ Applying Law of Cosines on $\triangle{ADF}$ we have, \[AF^2 = 144+x^2 - 2\cdot 12 \cdot x \cdot \cos{\theta} = 144+x^2 - \frac{72x}{5}.\] Next notice that $\cos{\angle{BDF}} = \cos{(90 + \theta)} = -\sin{\theta} = \frac{-4}{5}.$ Now we apply Law of Cosines on $\triangle{BDF},$ \[BF^2 = 25 + x^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot x \cdot \cos{\angle{BDF}} = 25 + x^2 + 8x.\] Finally using Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle{ABF}$ we have, \[AB^2 = AF^2 + BF^2.\] \[13^2 = 144+x^2 - \frac{72x}{5} + 25 + x^2 + 8x.\] \[0 = 2x^2 - \frac{32x}{5}.\] Solving for the nonnegative value for $x$ we find $x = DF = \frac{16}{5} \implies \boxed{21}.$

## Solution 4
If we draw a diagram as given, but then add point $G$ on $\overline{BC}$ such that $\overline{FG}\perp\overline{BC}$ in order to use the Pythagorean theorem, we end up with similar triangles $\triangle{DFG}$ and $\triangle{DCE}$ . Thus, $FG=\tfrac35x$ and $DG=\tfrac45x$ , where $x$ is the length of $\overline{DF}$ . Using the Pythagorean theorem, we now get \[BF = \sqrt{\left(\frac45x+ 5\right)^2 + \left(\frac35x\right)^2}\] and $AF$ can be found out noting that $AE$ is just $\tfrac{48}5$ through base times height (since $12\cdot 9 = 15 \cdot \tfrac{36}5$ , similar triangles gives $AE = \tfrac{48}5$ ), and that $EF$ is just $\tfrac{36}5 - x$ . From there, \[AF = \sqrt{\left(\frac{36}5 - x\right)^2 + \left(\frac{48}5\right)^2}.\] Now, $BF^2 + AF^2 = 169$ , and squaring and adding both sides and subtracting a 169 from both sides gives $2x^2 - \tfrac{32}5x = 0$ , so $x = \tfrac{16}5$ . Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$ .

## Solution 5 (Power of a Point)
First, we find $BD = 5$ , $DC = 9$ , and $AD = 12$ via the Pythagorean Theorem or by using similar triangles. Next, because $DE$ is an altitude of triangle $ADC$ , $DE = \frac{AD\cdot DC}{AC} = \frac{36}{5}$ . Using that, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem and similar triangles to find $EC = \frac{27}{5}$ and $AE = \frac{48}{5}$ .
Points $A$ , $B$ , $D$ , and $F$ all lie on a circle whose diameter is $AB$ . Let the point where the circle intersects $AC$ be $G$ . Using power of a point, we can write the following equation to solve for $AG$ : \[DC\cdot BC = CG\cdot AC\] \[9\cdot 14 = CG\cdot 15\] \[CG = 126/15\] Using that, we can find $AG = \frac{99}{15}$ , and using $AG$ , we can find that $GE = 3$ .
We can use power of a point again to solve for $DF$ : \[FE\cdot DE = GE\cdot AE\] \[(\frac{36}{5} - DF)\cdot \frac{36}{5} = 3 \cdot \frac{48}{5}\] \[\frac{36}{5} - DF = 4\] \[DF = \frac{16}{5} = \frac{m}{n}\] Thus, $m+n = 16+5 = 21$ $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$ .

## Solution 6 (Coord Bash)
If we draw the diagram like above, but make $BC$ the base, we can set $B(0,0), C(14,0)$ and $A(5,12)$ , as $AD$ can quickly be verified to be $12$ by Pythagorean triples or similar triangles. Construct $X$ on $BC$ such that $EX \perp BC$ . This implies $\triangle ADC \sim \triangle EXC$ as $AD \parallel EX$ , and $\angle ACD = \angle ECX$ . Also construct $FY$ such that $FY \perp BC$ .
Line $\overline {AC}$ has a slope of $-\frac{4}{3}$ by slope formula. Since $D = (5,0)$ and $DE \perp AC,$ , the equation of $DE = \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{15}{4}$ .
Furthermore, $F$ can now be expressed as $(x,\frac{3}{4}x - \frac{15}{4}).$ Since we know $AF \perp BF,$ we can solve for $x$ with the perpendicular slope formula like so: \[\frac{\frac{3}{4}x - \frac{63}{4}}{x - 5} \cdot \frac{\frac{3}{4}x - \frac {15}{4}}{x} = -1\] \[\frac{x-21}{x-5} \cdot \frac{x-5}{x} = -\frac{16}{9}\] \[\frac{x-21}{x} = -\frac{16}{9}\] \[9x = 189 -16x\] \[x = \frac{189}{25}\]
Plugging $\frac{189}{25}$ into $F$ , we get $F(\frac{189}{25},\frac{48}{25}).$ Since $FY \perp DY$ , we get that $\triangle FYD$ has side lengths of $FY = \frac{48}{25}$
and $DY = BY - BD = BY - 5 = \frac{64}{25}$ .
Clearly, $\triangle FYD$ is a $3 - 4 - 5$ pythagorean triple, so $DF = \frac{80}{25} = \frac{16}{5}$ .
$16 + 5 = m + n = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }21}$ .

## Solution 7 (Fakesolve)
We assume that triangle \( ABF \) is a 30-60-90 triangle, and \( E \) and \( F \) is the midpoint of \( AC \) and \( DE \) respectively.
Then, length \( BF \) is \( \frac{13}{2} \), and length \( AF \) is \( \frac{13\sqrt{3}}{2} \).
If \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AC \) and \( AC=15 \), then \( AE = \frac{15}{2} \). We see that \( \triangle DAE \) is a right angle triangle with hypotenuse \( \frac{13\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so
\[AE^2 + EF^2 = AF^2\]
\[\Rightarrow \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2 + EF^2 = \left(\frac{13\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2\]
\[\Rightarrow \frac{225}{4} + EF^2 = \frac{13^2 \cdot 3}{4}\]
\[\Rightarrow \frac{225}{4} + EF^2 = \frac{507}{4}\]
\[\Rightarrow EF^2 = \frac{507}{4} - \frac{225}{4}\]
\[\Rightarrow EF^2 = \frac{282}{4}\]
\[\Rightarrow EF \approx \frac{16.8}{2}\]
We know that while \( E \) and \( F \) are not exactly the midpoints of \( AC \) and \( DE \), and therefore the lengths \( DF \) would be a smaller fraction, and \( m+n \) would be bigger. So, we take the nearest answer choice which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }21}$ .
