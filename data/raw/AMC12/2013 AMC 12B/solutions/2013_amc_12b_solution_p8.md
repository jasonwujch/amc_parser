## Problem

Line $l_1$ has equation $3x - 2y = 1$ and goes through $A = (-1, -2)$ . Line $l_2$ has equation $y = 1$ and meets line $l_1$ at point $B$ . Line $l_3$ has positive slope, goes through point $A$ , and meets $l_2$ at point $C$ . The area of $\triangle ABC$ is $3$ . What is the slope of $l_3$ ?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{2}{3} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{3}{4} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 1 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{4}{3} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{3}{2}$

## Solution 1
Line $l_1$ has the equation $y=3x/2-1/2$ when rearranged. Substituting $1$ for $y$ , we find that line $l_2$ will meet this line at point $(1,1)$ , which is point $B$ . We call $\overline{BC}$ the base and the altitude from $A$ to the line connecting $B$ and $C$ , $y=-1$ , the height. The altitude has length $|-2-1|=3$ , and the area of $\triangle{ABC}=3$ . Since $A={bh}/2$ , $b=2$ . Because $l_3$ has positive slope, it will meet $l_2$ to the right of $B$ , and the point $2$ to the right of $B$ is $(3,1)$ . $l_3$ passes through $(-1,-2)$ and $(3,1)$ , and thus has slope $\frac{|1-(-2)|}{|3-(-1)|}=$ $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{3}{4}}$ .

## Solution 2 - Shoelace Theorem
We know lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ intersect at $B$ , so we can solve for that point: \[3x-2y=1\] Because $y = 1$ we have: \[3x-2(1) = 1\] \[3x-2=1\] \[3x=3\] \[x = 1\]
Thus we have $B = (1,1)$ .
We know that the area of the triangle is $3$ , so by Shoelace Theorem we have:
\[A = \dfrac{1}{2} |(-2x+y-1) - (-2+x-y)|\] \[A = \dfrac{1}{2} |-2x+y-1+2-x+y|\] \[3 = \dfrac{1}{2} |-2x+y-1+2-x+y|\] \[6 = |-3x+2y+1|.\]
Thus we have two options:
\[6 = -3x+2y+1\] \[5 = -3x+2y\]
or
\[6 = 3x-2y-1\] \[7 = 3x-2y.\]
Now we must just find a point that satisfies $m_{l_3}$ is positive.
Since ${l_3}$ intersects ${l_2}$ at $y=1$ , from the second equation:
\[7 = 3x-2(1)\] \[7+2 = 3x\] \[x=3\]
so a valid point here is $(3,1)$ . When calculated, the slope of $l_3$ in this situation yields $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{3}{4}}$ .
