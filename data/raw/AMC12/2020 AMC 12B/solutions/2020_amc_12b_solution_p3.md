## Problem

The ratio of $w$ to $x$ is $4:3$ , the ratio of $y$ to $z$ is $3:2$ , and the ratio of $z$ to $x$ is $1:6$ . What is the ratio of $w$ to $y?$

$\textbf{(A)}\ 4:3 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 3:2 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 8:3 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 4:1 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 16:3$

## Solution 1 (One Sentence)
We have \[\frac wy = \frac wx \cdot \frac xz \cdot \frac zy = \frac43\cdot\frac61\cdot\frac23=\frac{16}{3},\] from which $w:y=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 16:3}.$

## Solution 2
We need to somehow link all three of the ratios together. We can start by connecting the last two ratios together by multiplying the last ratio by two.
$z:x=1:6=2:12$ , and since $y:z=3:2$ , we can link them together to get $y:z:x=3:2:12$ .
Finally, since $x:w=3:4=12:16$ , we can link this again to get: $y:z:x:w=3:2:12:16$ , so $w:y = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 16:3}$ .

## Solution 3
We have the equations $\frac{w}{x}=\frac{4}{3}$ , $\frac{y}{z}=\frac{3}{2}$ , and $\frac{z}{x}=\frac{1}{6}$ . Clearing denominators, we have $3w = 4x$ , $2y = 3z$ , and $6z = x$ . Since we want $\frac{w}{y}$ , we look to find $y$ in terms of $x$ since we know the relationship between $x$ and $w$ . We begin by multiplying both sides of $2y = 3z$ by two, obtaining $4y = 6z$ . We then substitute that into $6z = x$ to get $4y = x$ . Now, to be able to substitute this into out first equation, we need to have $4x$ on the RHS. Multiplying both sides by $4$ , we have $16y = 4x$ . Substituting this into our first equation, we have $3w = 16y$ , or $\frac{w}{y}=\frac{16}{3}$ , so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 16:3}$ .

## Solution 4
WLOG, let $w=4$ and $x=3$ .
Since the ratio of $z$ to $x$ is $1:6$ , we can substitute in the value of $x$ to get $\frac{z}{3}=\frac{1}{6} \implies z=\frac{1}{2}$ .
The ratio of $y$ to $z$ is $3:2$ , so $\frac{y}{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{3}{2} \implies y=\frac{3}{4}$ .
The ratio of $w$ to $y$ is then $\frac{4}{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{16}{3}$ so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 16:3}$ .

## Solution 5
We have $\frac{w}{x}=\frac{4}{3}, \frac{y}{z}=\frac{3}{2}, \frac{z}{x}=\frac{1}{6}.$ Find LCD: $\frac{w}{x}=\frac{8}{6}, \frac{z}{x}=\frac{1}{6}$ , we have $\frac{w}{z}=\frac{8}{1}.$ Similarly, $\frac{w}{z}=\frac{16}{2}, \frac{y}{z}=\frac{3}{2},$ so $\frac{w}{y}=\frac{16}{3},$ $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 16:3}$ .
