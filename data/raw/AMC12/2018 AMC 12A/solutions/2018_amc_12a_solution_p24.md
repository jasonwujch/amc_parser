# 2018 AMC 12A Problem 24

## Problem

Alice, Bob, and Carol play a game in which each of them chooses a real number between $0$ and $1.$ The winner of the game is the one whose number is between the numbers chosen by the other two players. Alice announces that she will choose her number uniformly at random from all the numbers between $0$ and $1,$ and Bob announces that he will choose his number uniformly at random from all the numbers between $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\tfrac{2}{3}.$ Armed with this information, what number should Carol choose to maximize her chance of winning?

$\textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{2}\qquad \textbf{(B) }\frac{13}{24} \qquad \textbf{(C) }\frac{7}{12} \qquad \textbf{(D) }\frac{5}{8} \qquad \textbf{(E) }\frac{2}{3}\qquad$

## Solution 1 (Expected Values)
The expected value of Alice's number is $\frac12\left(0+1\right)=\frac12,$ and the expected value of Bob's number is $\frac12\left(\frac12+\frac23\right)=\frac{7}{12}.$ To maximize her chance of winning, Carol should choose the midpoint between these two expected values. So, the answer is $\frac12\left(\frac12+\frac{7}{12}\right)=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{13}{24}}.$
Alternatively, once we recognize that the answer lies in the interval $\left(\frac12,\frac{7}{12}\right),$ we should choose $\textbf{(B)}$ since no other answer choices lie in this interval.

## Solution 2 (Piecewise Function)
Let $a,b,$ and $c$ be the numbers that Alice, Bob, and Carol choose, respectively.
Based on the value of $c,$ we construct the following table: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c} & & \\ [-2ex] \textbf{Case} & \textbf{Conditions for }\boldsymbol{a}\textbf{ and }\boldsymbol{b} & \textbf{Carol's Probability of Winning} \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & \\ [-1.5ex] 0<c<\frac12 & 0<a<c \text{ and } \frac12<b<\frac23 & \hspace{1.25mm}\frac{c}{1}\cdot\frac{1/6}{1/6}=c \\ [1.5ex] \frac12\leq c\leq\frac23 & \left(0<a<c \text{ and } c<b<\frac23\right) \text{ or } \left(c<a<1 \text{ and } \frac12<b<c\right) & \hspace{1.25mm}\frac{c}{1}\cdot\frac{2/3-c}{1/6}+\frac{1-c}{1}\cdot\frac{c-1/2}{1/6}=-12c^2+13c-3 \\ [1.5ex] \frac23<c<1 & c<a<1 \text{ and } \frac12<b<\frac23 & \hspace{4.375mm}\frac{1-c}{1}\cdot\frac{1/6}{1/6}=1-c \\ [1.5ex] \end{array}\] Let $P(c)$ be Carol's probability of winning when she chooses $c.$ We write $P(c)$ as a piecewise function: \[P(c) = \begin{cases} c & \mathrm{if} \ 0<c<\frac12 \\ -12c^2+13c-3 & \mathrm{if} \ \frac12\leq c\leq\frac23 \\ 1-c & \mathrm{if} \ \frac23<c<1 \end{cases}.\] Note that $P(c)$ is continuous in the interval $(0,1),$ increasing in the interval $\left(0,\frac12\right),$ increasing and then decreasing in the interval $\left(\frac12,\frac23\right),$ and decreasing in the interval $\left(\frac23,1\right).$ The graph of $y=P(c)$ is shown below.

## Solution 3 (Answer Choices)
Let $a,b,$ and $c$ be the numbers that Alice, Bob, and Carol choose, respectively.
From the answer choices, we construct the following table: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c} & & \\ [-2ex] \boldsymbol{c} & \textbf{Conditions for }\boldsymbol{a}\textbf{ and }\boldsymbol{b} & \textbf{Carol's Probability of Winning} \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & \\ [-1.5ex] \frac12 & 0<a<\frac12 \text{ and } \frac12<b<\frac23 & \hspace{23.375mm}\frac{1/2}{1}\cdot\frac{1/6}{1/6}=\frac12 \\ [1.5ex] \frac{13}{24} & \left(0<a<\frac{13}{24} \text{ and } \frac{13}{24}<b<\frac23\right) \text{ or } \left(\frac{13}{24}<a<1 \text{ and } \frac12<b<\frac{13}{24}\right) & \frac{13/24}{1}\cdot\frac{1/8}{1/6}+\frac{11/24}{1}\cdot\frac{1/24}{1/6}=\frac{25}{48} \\ [1.5ex] \frac{7}{12} & \left(0<a<\frac{7}{12} \text{ and } \frac{7}{12}<b<\frac23\right) \text{ or } \left(\frac{7}{12}<a<1 \text{ and } \frac12<b<\frac{7}{12}\right) & \frac{7/12}{1}\cdot\frac{1/12}{1/6}+\frac{5/12}{1}\cdot\frac{1/12}{1/6}=\frac12 \\ [1.5ex] \frac58 & \left(0<a<\frac58 \text{ and } \frac58<b<\frac23\right) \text{ or } \left(\frac58<a<1 \text{ and } \frac12<b<\frac58\right) & \hspace{5.625mm}\frac{5/8}{1}\cdot\frac{1/24}{1/6}+\frac{3/8}{1}\cdot\frac{1/8}{1/6}=\frac{7}{16} \\ [1.5ex] \frac23 & \frac23<a<1 \text{ and } \frac12<b<\frac23 & \hspace{23.25mm}\frac{1/3}{1}\cdot\frac{1/6}{1/6}=\frac13 \\ [1.5ex] \end{array}\] Therefore, Carol should choose $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{13}{24}}$ to maximize her chance of winning.

## Solution 4 (Calculus)
Note that Carol's number must lie in the interval $\left[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}\right]$ because it never needs to be less than $\frac{1}{2}$ in order to be less than Bob's number, and it never needs to be greater than $\frac{2}{3}$ in order to be greater than Bob's number. Going past either value will only decrease the probability of being on the correct side of Alice's number.
There are two cases of winning:
Case 1: Alice chooses a number that is smaller than Carol's, and Bob chooses a number that is bigger.
Case 2: Alice chooses a number that is bigger than Carol's, and Bob chooses a number that is smaller.
Let Carol's number be $\frac{1}{2}+x$ , where $x \in \left[0, \frac{1}{6}\right]$ . The probability of Case 1 can be expressed as $\frac{\frac{1}{2} + x}{1}\cdot\frac{\frac{1}{6} - x}{\frac{1}{6}}=\left(\frac{1}{2} + x\right)\left(1 - 6x\right)$ , and the probability of Case 2 can be expressed as $\frac{\frac{1}{2} - x}{1}\cdot\frac{x}{\frac{1}{6}}=\left(\frac{1}{2} - x\right)\left(6x\right)$ .
Thus, the probability of Carol winning can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of Cases 1 and 2: $P = \left(\frac{1}{2} + x\right)\left(1 - 6x\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - x\right)\left(6x\right)$ , which simplifies to $P = \frac{1}{2} + x - 12x^2$ . The maximum value of $P$ is obtained through the value of $x$ where the slope is $0$ . We take the first derivative and get $1 - 24x$ , which yields $0$ at $x = \frac{1}{24}$ . Hence, Carol should select $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{24} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{13}{24}}$ .
Note that the same value of $x$ can be obtained through the Vertex Formula, $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$ , without using Calculus.

## Solution 5 (Calculus)
It suffices to find the average (expected) value of $C=\frac{\left(A+B\right)}{2}$ over the intervals $A \in \left[0,1\right]$ and $B \in \left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3}\right]$ . We do this by finding $\int_0^1 \int_\frac{1}{2}^\frac{2}{3}\frac{\left(A+B\right)}{2}\,dB\,dA$ and divide by the area of the interval we're integrating over, namely ${\left(1-0\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{2}\right)}=\frac{1}{6}$ . $\int_0^1 \left[\frac{AB}{2}+\frac{B^2}{4}\right]_{B=\frac{1}{2}}^\frac{2}{3}\,dA = \left[\frac{A^2}{24}+\frac{7A}{144}\right]_{A=0}^1=\frac{13}{144}$ . Dividing by $\frac{1}{6}$ we get $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{13}{24}}$ .

## Solution 6
Draw a number line to visualize the situation. We have three important regions to consider: $0$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ , $\frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{2}{3}$ , and $\frac{2}{3}$ to $1$ .
If Carol chooses from $0$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ , then Alice will be towards her left, and Bob will be towards her right. Carol should choose $\frac{1}{2}$ to maximize her chance of winning, since she wants to maximize her left for Alice to choose. In this case, the probability that Alice will be towards Carol's left is just $\frac{1}{2}$ , so that is the probability of Carol winning. Meanwhile, if Carol chooses from $\frac{2}{3}$ to $1$ , then Bob will be towards her left, and Alice will be towards her right. Carol should choose $\frac{2}{3}$ for the same reason, and her probability of winning is then $\frac{1}{3}$ .
At this point, it is clear that Carol should not choose the latter region, her probability of winning is less than the first.
However, there is one more region to consider: $\frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{2}{3}$ . For this case, let Carol's number be C, and we will express the probability that Carol wins in terms of C.
There are two cases.
Case $1$ : Alice towards her left, and Bob towards her right.
The probability that Alice is towards Carol's left is simply $C/1$ , or $C.$
The probability that Bob is towards Carol's right is $(\frac{2}{3}-C)/(\frac{1}{6})$ .
Therefore, the probability of Carol winning in this case is $C(4-6C)$ .
Case $2$ : Bob towards her left, and Alice towards her right.
Similarly, in this case, the probability of Carol winning is $(1-C)(6C-3)$ .
Adding, we find that the probability that Carol wins is $-12C^2 + 13C - 3.$
To maximize this function, we either take the vertex value: $13/2(12) = 13/24$ , or take the derivative and set it to zero.
Either way, we find that the probability that Carol wins is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{13}{24}}$ , which is optimal since it is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ .
