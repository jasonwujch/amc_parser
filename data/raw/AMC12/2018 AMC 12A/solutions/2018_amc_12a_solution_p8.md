## Problem

All of the triangles in the diagram below are similar to isosceles triangle $ABC$ , in which $AB=AC$ . Each of the $7$ smallest triangles has area $1,$ and $\triangle ABC$ has area $40$ . What is the area of trapezoid $DBCE$ ?

[asy] unitsize(5); dot((0,0)); dot((60,0)); dot((50,10)); dot((10,10)); dot((30,30)); draw((0,0)--(60,0)--(50,10)--(30,30)--(10,10)--(0,0)); draw((10,10)--(50,10)); label("$B$",(0,0),SW); label("$C$",(60,0),SE); label("$E$",(50,10),E); label("$D$",(10,10),W); label("$A$",(30,30),N); draw((10,10)--(15,15)--(20,10)--(25,15)--(30,10)--(35,15)--(40,10)--(45,15)--(50,10)); draw((15,15)--(45,15)); [/asy]

$\textbf{(A) } 16 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 18 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 20 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 22 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 24$

## Solution 1
Let $x$ be the area of $ADE$ . Note that $x$ is comprised of the $7$ small isosceles triangles and a triangle similar to $ADE$ with side length ratio $3:4$ (so an area ratio of $9:16$ ). Thus, we have \[x=7+\dfrac{9}{16}x.\] This gives $x=16$ , so the area of $DBCE=40-x=\boxed{(E) 24}$ .

## Solution 2
Let the base length of the small triangle be $x$ . Then, there is a triangle $ADE$ encompassing the 7 small triangles and sharing the top angle with a base length of $4x$ . Because the area is proportional to the square of the side, let the base $BC$ be $\sqrt{40}x$ . The ratio of the area of triangle $ADE$ to triangle $ABC$ is $\left(\frac{4x}{\sqrt{40}x}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{40}$ . The problem says the area of triangle $ABC$ is $40$ , so the area of triangle $ADE$ is $16$ . So the area of trapezoid $DBCE$ is $40 - 16 = \boxed{24}$ .

## Solution 3
Notice $\big[DBCE\big]=\big[ABC\big]-\big[ADE\big]$ . Let the base of the small triangles of area 1 be $x$ , then the base length of $\Delta ADE=4x$ . Notice, $\left(\frac{DE}{BC}\right)^2=\frac{1}{40}\implies \frac{x}{BC}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{40}}$ , then $4x=\frac{4BC}{\sqrt{40}}\implies \big[ADE\big]=\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{40}}\right)^2\cdot \big[ABC\big]=\frac{2}{5}\big[ABC\big]$ Thus, $\big[DBCE\big]=\big[ABC\big]-\big[ADE\big]=\big[ABC\big]\left(1-\frac{2}{5}\right)=\frac{3}{5}\cdot 40=\boxed{24}.$

## Solution 4
The area of $ADE$ is 16 times the area of the small triangle, as they are similar and their side ratio is $4:1$ . Therefore the area of the trapezoid is $40-16=\boxed{24}$ .

## Solution 5
You can see that we can create a "stack" of 5 triangles congruent to the 7 small triangles shown here, arranged in a row above those 7, whose total area would be 5. Similarly, we can create another row of 3, and finally 1 more at the top, as follows. We know this cumulative area will be $7+5+3+1=16$ , so to find the area of such trapezoid $BCED$ , we just take $40-16=\boxed{24}$ , like so.

## Solution 6
The combined area of the small triangles is $7$ , and from the fact that each small triangle has an area of $1$ , we can deduce that the larger triangle above has an area of $9$ (as the sides of the triangles are in a proportion of $\frac{1}{3}$ , so will their areas have a proportion that is the square of the proportion of their sides, or $\frac {1}{9}$ ). Thus, the combined area of the top triangle and the trapezoid immediately below is $7 + 9 = 16$ . The area of trapezoid $BCED$ is thus the area of triangle $ABC-16 =\boxed{24}$ .

## Solution 7
You can assume for the base of one of the smaller triangles to be $\frac{1}{a}$ and the height to be $2a$ , giving an area of 1. The larger triangle above the 7 smaller ones then has base $\frac{3}{a}$ and height $6a$ , giving it an area of $9$ . Then the area of triangle $ADE$ is $16$ and $40-16=\boxed{24}$ .

## Solution 8
You can construct another trapezoid directly above the one shown, with it's bottom length as the top length of the original. Its area would then be 9/16 of the original. Repeating this process infinitely gives us the sequence $7\cdot\left(1+\left(\frac{9}{16}\right)+\left(\frac{9}{16}\right)^2+\left(\frac{9}{16}\right)^3\dots\right)$ . Using the infinite geometric series sum formula gives us $7\cdot\left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{9}{16}}\right)=7\cdot\frac{16}{7}=16$ . The triangle's area would thus be $40-16=\boxed{24}$ .

## Solution 9 (weird)
Note that the area of an isosceles triangle is equivalent to the square of its height. Using this information, the height of the smallest isosceles triangle is $1$ , and thus its base is $2.$
Let $h$ be the height of the top triangle. We can set up a height-to-base similarity ratio, using the top triangle and $\triangle{ADE}$ . The top triangle has a base of $3\cdot{2}=6$ , and $DE=4\cdot{2}=8.$ The height of $\triangle{ADE}$ is $h+1$ , therefore our ratio is $\frac{h}{6}=\frac{h+1}{8}$ , which yields $h=3$ as our answer.
To find the area of the trapezoid, we can take the area of $\triangle{ABC}$ and subtract the area of $\triangle{ADE},$ whose base is $8$ and height $3+1=4$ . It follows that the area of $\triangle{ADE}=16$ , and subtracting this from $40$ gives us $40-16=\boxed{\text{D) }24}$ .

## Solution 10 (Pretty standard)
Since each of the smallest triangles have area $1$ , we have the combined area of them is $7$ . Also, we know that every triangle is similar to big one. Therefore the triangle above the stack of triangles has area of $3^2 = 9$ , because the side length is $3$ , so we can just square it to find the area. Now to find the area of trapezoid $BCDE$ we can just do: \[40-(9+7) = 40-16=\boxed{\text{E) }24}\] -jb2015007
