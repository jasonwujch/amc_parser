## Problem

Suppose $a$ is $150\%$ of $b$ . What percent of $a$ is $3b$ ?

$\textbf{(A) } 50 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 66+\frac{2}{3} \qquad \textbf{(C) } 150 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 200 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 450$

## Solution 1
Since $a=1.5b$ , that means $b=\frac{a}{1.5}$ . We multiply by $3$ to get a $3b$ term, yielding $3b=2a$ , and $2a$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }200\%}$ of $a$ .

## Solution 2
Without loss of generality, let $b=100$ . Then, we have $a=150$ and $3b=300$ . Thus, $\frac{3b}{a}=\frac{300}{150}=2$ , so $3b$ is $200\%$ of $a$ . Hence the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }200\%}$ .

## Solution 3 (similar to Solution 1)
As before, $a = 1.5b$ . Multiply by 2 to obtain $2a = 3b$ . Since $2 = 200\%$ , the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }200\%}$ .

## Solution 4 (similar to Solution 2)
Without loss of generality, let $b=2$ . Then, we have $a=3$ and $3b=6$ . This gives $\frac{3b}{a}=\frac{6}{3}=2$ , so $3b$ is $200\%$ of $a$ , so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }200\%}$ .
