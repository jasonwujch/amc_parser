## Solution 1
The $5$ and $7$ can be painted with no restrictions because the set of integers does not contain a multiple or proper factor of $5$ or $7$ . There are 3 ways to paint each, giving us $\underline{9}$ ways to paint both. The $2$ is the most restrictive number. There are $\underline{3}$ ways to paint $2$ , but without loss of generality, let it be painted red. $4$ cannot be the same color as $2$ or $8$ , so there are $\underline{2}$ ways to paint $4$ , which automatically determines the color for $8$ . $6$ cannot be painted red, so there are $\underline{2}$ ways to paint $6$ , but WLOG, let it be painted blue. There are $\underline{2}$ choices for the color for $3$ , which is either red or green in this case. Lastly, there are $\underline{2}$ ways to choose the color for $9$ .
$9 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }432}$ .

## Solution 2
We note that the primes can be colored any of the $3$ colors since they don't have any proper divisors other than $1$ , which is not in the list. Furthermore, $6$ is the only number in the list that has $2$ distinct prime factors (namely, $2$ and $3$ ), so we do casework on $6$ .
Case 1 : $2$ and $3$ are the same color
In this case, we have $3$ primes to choose the color for ( $2$ , $5$ , and $7$ ). Afterwards, $4$ , $6$ , and $9$ have two possible colors, which will determine the color of $8$ . Thus, there are $3^3\cdot 2^3=216$ possibilities here.
Case 2 : $2$ and $3$ are different colors
In this case, we have $4$ primes to color. Without loss of generality, we'll color the $2$ first, then the $3$ . Then there are $3$ color choices for $2,5,7$ , and $2$ color choices for $3$ . This will determine the color of $6$ as well. After that, we only need to choose the color for $4$ and $9$ , which each have $2$ choices. Thus, there are $3^3\cdot 2^3=216$ possibilities here as well.
Adding up gives $216+216=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }432}$ .

## Solution 3
$2,4,8$ require different colors each, so there are $6$ ways to color these.
$5$ and $7$ can be any color, so there are $3\times 3$ ways to color these.
$6$ can have $2$ colors once $2$ is colored, and thus $3$ also has $2$ colors following $6$ , which leaves another $2$ for $9$ .
All together: $6\times 3 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 432 \Rightarrow \boxed{E}$ .
