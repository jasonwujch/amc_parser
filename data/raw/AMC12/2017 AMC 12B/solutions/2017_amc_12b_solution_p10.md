# 2017 AMC 12B Problem 10

## Problem

At Typico High School, $60\%$ of the students like dancing, and the rest dislike it. Of those who like dancing, $80\%$ say that they like it, and the rest say that they dislike it. Of those who dislike dancing, $90\%$ say that they dislike it, and the rest say that they like it. What fraction of students who say they dislike dancing actually like it?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 10\%\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 12\%\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 20\%\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 25\%\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{100}{3}\%$

## Solution 1
WLOG, let there be $100$ students. $60$ of them like dancing, and $40$ do not. Of those who like dancing, $20\%$ , or $12$ of them say they dislike dancing. Of those who dislike dancing, $90\%$ , or $36$ of them say they dislike it. Thus, $\frac{12}{12+36} = \frac{12}{48} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\% \boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$

## Solution 2 (Bayes' Theorem)
The question can be translated into P(Likes|Says Dislike).
By Bayes' Theorem, this is equal to the probability of $\frac{\textnormal{P(Likes} \cap \textnormal{Says Dislike)}}{\textnormal{P(Says Dislike)}}$ . $\textnormal{P(Likes} \cap \textnormal{Says Dislike)} = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12$ , and $\textnormal{P(Says Dislike)} = (0.4 \cdot 0.9) + (0.6 \cdot 0.2) = 0.48$ . Therefore, you get a probability of $\frac{0.12}{0.48} = 25\% \boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$
