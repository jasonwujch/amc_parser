# 2017 AMC 12B Problem 1

## Problem

Kymbrea's comic book collection currently has $30$ comic books in it, and she is adding to her collection at the rate of $2$ comic books per month. LaShawn's collection currently has $10$ comic books in it, and he is adding to his collection at the rate of $6$ comic books per month. After how many months will LaShawn's collection have twice as many comic books as Kymbrea's?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 5\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 20\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 25$

## Solution
Kymbrea has $30$ comic books initially and every month, she adds two. This can be represented as $30 + 2x$ where x is the number of months elapsed. LaShawn's collection, similarly, is $10 + 6x$ . To find when LaShawn will have twice the number of comic books as Kymbrea, we solve for x with the equation $2(2x + 30) = 6x + 10$ and get $x = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 25}$ .
