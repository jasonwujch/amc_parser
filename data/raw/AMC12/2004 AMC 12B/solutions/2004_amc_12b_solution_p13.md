## Problem

If $f(x) = ax+b$ and $f^{-1}(x) = bx+a$ with $a$ and $b$ real, what is the value of $a+b$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ -2 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ -1 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 0 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 1 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 2$

## Solution (Alcumus)
Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ , it follows that $a(bx+a)+b=x$ , which implies $abx + a^2 +b = x$ . This equation holds for all values of $x$ only if $ab=1$ and $a^2+b=0$ .
Then $b = -a^2$ . Substituting into the equation $ab = 1$ , we get $-a^3 = 1$ . Then $a = -1$ , so $b = -1$ , and \[f(x)=-x-1.\] Likewise \[f^{-1}(x)=-x-1.\] These are inverses to one another since \[f(f^{-1}(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\] \[f^{-1}(f(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\] Therefore $a+b=\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ -2}$ .
note: you could just find that $a=-1$ and $b=-1$ and add, getting $-2$ .
