# 2004 AMC 12B Problem 19

## Problem

A truncated cone has horizontal bases with radii $18$ and $2$ . A sphere is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of the truncated cone. What is the radius of the sphere?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 6 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 4\sqrt{5} \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 9 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 10 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 6\sqrt{3}$

## Solution
Consider a trapezoid (label it $ABCD$ as follows) cross-section of the truncate cone along a diameter of the bases:
Above, $E,F,$ and $G$ are points of tangency . By the Two Tangent Theorem, $BF = BE = 18$ and $CF = CG = 2$ , so $BC = 20$ . We draw $H$ such that it is the foot of the altitude $\overline{HD}$ to $\overline{AB}$ :
By the Pythagorean Theorem , \[r = \frac{DH}2 = \frac{\sqrt{20^2 - 16^2}}2 = 12\] Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{{A (6)}}.$
