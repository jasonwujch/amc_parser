# 2004 AMC 12B Problem 11

## Problem

All the students in an algebra class took a $100$ -point test. Five students scored $100$ , each student scored at least $60$ , and the mean score was $76$ . What is the smallest possible number of students in the class?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 10 \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 11 \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 12 \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 13 \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 14$

## Solution 1
Let the number of students be $n\geq 5$ . Then the sum of their scores is at least $5\cdot 100 + (n-5)\cdot 60$ . At the same time, we need to achieve the mean $76$ , which is equivalent to achieving the sum $76n$ .
Hence we get a necessary condition on $n$ : we must have $5\cdot 100 + (n-5)\cdot 60 \leq 76n$ . This can be simplified to $200 \leq 16n$ . The smallest integer $n$ for which this is true is $n=13$ .
To finish our solution, we now need to find one way how $13$ students could have scored on the test. We have $13\cdot 76 = 988$ points to divide among them. The five $100$ s make $500$ , hence we must divide the remaining $488$ points among the other $8$ students. This can be done e.g. by giving $61$ points to each of them.
Hence the smallest possible number of students is $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 13}$ .

## Solution 2
Let's assume that each student scores 60 points on the test. This gives $(500 + 60(n))/(n+5) = 76$
Solving the equation for $n$ we see that $n = 7.5$ .
Because of the extra five people we know that the total amount of people is $12.5$ , however, to adjust for the complexity of not every score being a $60$ we round up to $13$ . Giving $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 13}$ .
