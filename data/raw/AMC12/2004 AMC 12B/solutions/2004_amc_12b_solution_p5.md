## Problem

On a trip from the United States to Canada, Isabella took $d$ U.S. dollars. At the border she exchanged them all, receiving $10$ Canadian dollars for every $7$ U.S. dollars. After spending $60$ Canadian dollars, she had $d$ Canadian dollars left. What is the sum of the digits of $d$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)\ }5\qquad\mathrm{(B)\ }6\qquad\mathrm{(C)\ }7\qquad\mathrm{(D)\ }8\qquad\mathrm{(E)\ }9$

## Solution 1
Isabella had $60+d$ Canadian dollars. Setting up an equation we get $d=\frac{7}{10}\cdot(60+d)$ , which solves to $d=140$ , and the sum of digits of $d$ is $\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 5}$ .

## Solution 2
Each time Isabella exchanges $7$ U.S. dollars, she gets $7$ Canadian dollars and $3$ Canadian dollars extra. Isabella received a total of $60$ Canadian dollars extra, therefore she exchanged $7$ U.S. dollars $\frac{60}{3}=20$ times. Thus $d=7\cdot20=140$ , and the sum of the digits is $\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 5}$ .
