# 2004 AMC 12B Problem 1

## Problem

At each basketball practice last week, Jenny made twice as many free throws as she made at the previous practice. At her fifth practice she made 48 free throws. How many free throws did she make at the first practice?

$(\mathrm {A}) 3\qquad (\mathrm {B}) 6 \qquad (\mathrm {C}) 9 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) 12 \qquad (\mathrm {E}) 15$

## Solution
Each day Jenny makes half as many free throws as she does at the next practice. Hence on the fourth day she made $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 48 = 24$ free throws, on the third $12$ , on the second $6$ , and on the first $3 \Rightarrow \mathrm{(A)}$ .
Because there are five days, or four transformations between days (day 1 $\rightarrow$ day 2 $\rightarrow$ day 3 $\rightarrow$ day 4 $\rightarrow$ day 5), she makes $48 \cdot \frac{1}{2^4} = \boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 3}$
