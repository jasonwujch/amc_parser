## Problem

The graph of $2x^2 + xy + 3y^2 - 11x - 20y + 40 = 0$ is an ellipse in the first quadrant of the $xy$ -plane. Let $a$ and $b$ be the maximum and minimum values of $\frac yx$ over all points $(x,y)$ on the ellipse. What is the value of $a+b$ ?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ 3 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \sqrt{10} \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \frac 72 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \frac 92 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 2\sqrt{14}$

## Solution
$\frac yx$ represents the slope of a line passing through the origin. It follows that since a line $y = mx$ intersects the ellipse at either $0, 1,$ or $2$ points, the minimum and maximum are given when the line $y = mx$ is a tangent, with only one point of intersection. Substituting, \[2x^2 + x(mx) + 3(mx)^2 - 11x - 20(mx) + 40 = 0\] Rearranging by the degree of $x$ , \[(3m^2 + m + 2)x^2 - (20m + 11)x + 40 = 0\] Since the line $y=mx$ is tangent to the ellipse, we want the discriminant, \[(20m+11)^2 - 4\cdot 40 \cdot (3m^2 + m + 2) = -80m^2 + 280m - 199\] to be equal to $0$ . We want $a+b$ , which is the sum of the roots of the above quadratic. By Vieta’s formulas , that is $\frac{280}{80} = \frac{7}{2} \Rightarrow \mathrm{(C)}$ .
