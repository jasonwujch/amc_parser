# 2021 Fall AMC 12B Problem 6

## Problem

The greatest prime number that is a divisor of $16{,}384$ is $2$ because $16{,}384 = 2^{14}$ . What is the sum of the digits of the greatest prime number that is a divisor of $16{,}383$ ?

$\textbf{(A)} \: 3\qquad\textbf{(B)} \: 7\qquad\textbf{(C)} \: 10\qquad\textbf{(D)} \: 16\qquad\textbf{(E)} \: 22$

## Solution
We have \begin{align*} 16383 & = 2^{14} - 1 \\ & = \left( 2^7 + 1 \right) \left( 2^7 - 1 \right) \\ & = 129 \cdot 127 \\ \end{align*}
Since $129$ is composite, $127$ is the largest prime which can divide $16383$ . The sum of $127$ 's digits is $1+2+7=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }10}$ .
