# 2021 Fall AMC 12B Problem 5

## Problem

Call a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ , not necessarily in the simplest form, special if $a$ and $b$ are positive integers whose sum is $15$ . How many distinct integers can be written as the sum of two, not necessarily different, special fractions?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 9 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 10 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 11 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 12 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 13$

## Solution 1
The special fractions are \[\frac{1}{14},\frac{2}{13},\frac{3}{12},\frac{4}{11},\frac{5}{10},\frac{6}{9},\frac{7}{8},\frac{8}{7},\frac{9}{6},\frac{10}{5},\frac{11}{4},\frac{12}{3},\frac{13}{2},\frac{14}{1}.\] We rewrite them in the simplest form: \[\frac{1}{14},\frac{2}{13},\frac{1}{4},\frac{4}{11},\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{7}{8},1\frac{1}{7},1\frac{1}{2},2,2\frac{3}{4},4,6\frac{1}{2},14.\] Note that two unlike fractions in the simplest form cannot sum to an integer. So, we only consider the fractions whose denominators appear more than once: \[\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2},1\frac{1}{2},2,2\frac{3}{4},4,6\frac{1}{2},14.\] For the set $\{2,4,14\},$ two elements (not necessarily different) can sum to $4,6,8,16,18,28.$
For the set $\left\{\frac{1}{2},1\frac{1}{2},6\frac{1}{2}\right\},$ two elements (not necessarily different) can sum to $1,2,3,7,8,13.$
For the set $\left\{\frac{1}{4},2\frac{3}{4}\right\},$ two elements (not necessarily different) can sum to $3.$
Together, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 11}$ distinct integers that can be written as the sum of two, not necessarily different, special fractions: \[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,13,16,18,28.\] ~KingRavi ~samrocksnature ~Wilhelm Z ~MRENTHUSIASM ~Steven Chen (www.professorchenedu.com)

## Solution 2
Let $a=15-b,$ so the special fraction is \[\frac ab = \frac{15-b}{b} = \frac{15}{b}-1.\] We can ignore the $-1$ part and only focus on $\frac{15}{b}.$
The integers are $\frac{15}{1},\frac{15}{3},\frac{15}{5},$ which are $15,5,3,$ respectively. We get $30,20,18,10,8,6$ from this group of numbers.
The halves are $\frac{15}{2},\frac{15}{6},\frac{15}{10},$ which are $7\frac12,2\frac12,1\frac12,$ respectively. We get $15,10,9,5,4,3$ from this group of numbers.
The quarters are $\frac{15}{4},\frac{15}{12},$ which are $3\frac34,1\frac14,$ respectively. We get $5$ from this group of numbers.
Note that $10$ and $5$ each appear twice. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 11}.$

## Solution 3 (Casework)
We split this up into two cases:
Case 1: integer + integer
The whole numbers we have are $\frac{10}{5}$ (or $2$ ), $\frac{12}{3}$ (or $4$ ), and $\frac{14}{1}$ (or $14$ ). There are $\dbinom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose different-numbered pairs and $3$ ways to choose the same-numbered pairs. So, $3+3=6$ .
Case 2: fraction + fraction
The fractions we have are $\frac{5}{10}$ (or $\frac{1}{2}$ ), $\frac{9}{6}$ (or $\frac{3}{2}$ ), and $\frac{13}{2}$ . Similarly, there are $\dbinom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose different-numbered pairs and $3$ ways to choose the same-numbered pairs. So, $3+3=6$ .
Thus, $6+6=12$ .
So now you would just go ahead and innocently choose $\textbf{(D) }12$ , right? No! We overcounted $8$ , as $\frac{13}{2}+\frac96=\frac{12}{3}+\frac{12}{3}=8$ . Therefore, the correct answer is actually $12-1=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 11}$ .
