## Problem

Una rolls $6$ standard $6$ -sided dice simultaneously and calculates the product of the $6{ }$ numbers obtained. What is the probability that the product is divisible by $4?$

$\textbf{(A)}\: \frac34\qquad\textbf{(B)} \: \frac{57}{64}\qquad\textbf{(C)} \: \frac{59}{64}\qquad\textbf{(D)} \: \frac{187}{192}\qquad\textbf{(E)} \: \frac{63}{64}$

## Solution
We will use complementary counting to find the probability that the product is not divisible by $4$ . Then, we can find the probability that we want by subtracting this from 1. We split this into $2$ cases.
Case 1: The product is not divisible by $2$ .
We need every number to be odd, and since the chance we roll an odd number is $\frac12,$ our probability is $\left(\frac12\right)^6=\frac1{64}.$
Case 2: The product is divisible by $2$ , but not by $4$ .
We need $5$ numbers to be odd, and one to be divisible by $2$ , but not by $4$ . There is a $\frac12$ chance that an odd number is rolled, a $\frac13$ chance that we roll a number satisfying the second condition (only $2$ and $6$ work), and $6$ ways to choose the order in which the even number appears.
Our probability is $\left(\frac12\right)^5\left(\frac13\right)\cdot6=\frac1{16}.$
Therefore, the probability the product is not divisible by $4$ is $\frac1{64}+\frac1{16}=\frac{5}{64}$ .
Our answer is $1-\frac{5}{64}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{59}{64}}$ .
